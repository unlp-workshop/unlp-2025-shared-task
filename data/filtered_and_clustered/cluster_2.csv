"We laugh at Russian drunkards, who sign up for a couple hundred dollars to die in a war that only benefits olligarchs. But higher class Russians arent dumb. They recruited Trump as an agent of influence 40 years ago, and have used him for the past near-decade to undermine all the efforts of generations of American public servants since WWII. If the face of America becomes this narcissistic bully Trump, every peace securing multilateral alliance is weakened or gone. Were back to the early 20th century again in terms of how nations respect another. It would be just disastrous for US foreign policy 40 years ago, but now that we know more about anthropogenic climate change and its effects that extend thousands of years into the future, its suicidal for human civilization. To put this in perspective, the election of Trump reduced global human carrying capacity by about 1% going forward, for the next 5-9 thousand years. Meaning every Trump voter in effect murdered a future human being.",2

"GREGGPOSTING evening update for ... Messages are pouring into my messenger asking what I think about the latest incident with the phone call between Trump and Putin.. There are absolutely no NEGOTIATIONS taking place, these are supposed to take place between Ukraine and Russia. Trump is following a mediators work schedule where he first DISCUSSES with both parties to hear their demands and positions. It is the media that is currently magnifying the discussion by calling it NEGOTIATIONS. Of course Trump likes this media circus because he is in the spotlight.. Listen to the ENTIRE interview of the American envoy and the Minister of Defense, the media cuts where they want to get sensations. The media is probably not the one who decides about the negotiations. In this matter, the Finnish press has actually had more ice in its hat than the Swedish. For some reason, the media is not highlighting that we have more than  km of land in Kursk. Even Trump doesnt believe in just asking us to leave Kursk without compensation.We are far from a ceasefire, it will take months just to agree on an agenda for peace talks, and the EU will also have its say on it, especially since Trump is demanding that the EU cover the costs.In principle, nothing new is happening, talks have been going on behind the scenes for a long time already. The only new thing now is the media frenzy with loose comments and wild speculation. What we will see on the fronts now is an escalated Ukrainian activity that will culminate in a massive attack sometime in April.SLAVA UKRAINi",2

National leaders were present yesterday at the the 80th anniversary of the German atrocity at Auschwitz. Yet, again we are watching a monster kill innocents day after day, and month after month, and year after year. Action to confront the bully, head on, by all supporting nations at the same time with overwhelming force is what‚Äôs needed to strangle the snake.",2

"Banks have begun to refuse loans to Russians en masse Russian banks have begun to refuse consumer loans to Russians en masse. In January, credit institutions approved only % of applications for consumer loans against % for the same period last year. This follows from data from the financial marketplace Sravni, which Izvestia cites. ‚Äú% is an unprecedented level of decline in the approval rate for at least the past few years,‚Äù said Magomed Gamzaev, director of the credit department at Sravni. Large banks confirmed to Izvestia the low level of approval of consumer loans in January of this year. According to preliminary data from Frank RG, in January, the total volume of loans issued (including mortgages, cash loans, car loans and POS loans) amounted to  billion rubles. ‚Äî this is the minimum result since April . The retail lending market cooled off last year due to the Central Banks tough policy, noted Alexey Volkov, Marketing Director of the National Bureau of Credit Histories. According to him, first of all, this is about raising the key rate to a record % and tightening quantitative restrictions on issuing loans to high-risk borrowers. Thus, on the one hand, the number of loan applications is decreasing, since the increase in rates forces many citizens to refuse to take out unsecured loans, and on the other hand, the approval rate for loan requests is also falling significantly. Thus, in December , this figure for unsecured loans was at the level of %, Volkov noted. The market expects that the high key rate will remain for a long time, so banks are tightening their lending policy and receiving target returns with a lower level of risk, says Ivan Uklein, Senior Director of Bank Ratings at Expert RA. He noted that against the backdrop of a slowdown in lending to individuals, financial institutions have increased their placements in deposits with the Central Bank and investments in securities.",2

How long this can be drawn noone can say. Maybe one year, maybe one week, who knows. But all know it will break. And the later it comes the heavier will be the impact as more resources have been squandered or stolen by oligarches ... or by putler and his group.
