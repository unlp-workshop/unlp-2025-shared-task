North Koreans are unauthorized lol

Come on South Korea, fill in for the US

When they attacked Ukrainian positions, the colonel said, Pyongyangs fighters sustained most of their casualties in the first few minutes of the assault. They repeatedly attack along the same routes where dozens of their troops have already been killed in action, Kindratenko said. Pyongyangs troops were very mobile, with some of the fighters shedding the protective gear Russia had provided, he said. In some instances, they operate without helmets or ballistic plates to increase speed during assaults on Ukrainian positions, Kindratenko said. Their confiscated backpacks held only scant food, a liter of water, and no cold-weather gear like gloves or thermal clothing. Most of the space in the Russian-issued backpacks is taken up by ammunition, the colonel said. North Korean troops have more than three times the number of magazines than the average Russian soldier carries, Kindratenko said, plus the supplies of grenades and landmines. Equipment recovered from the bodies of slain North Korean soldiers in Kursk indicate they are often better armed than Russian forces, the colonel added. The title seems a bit disingenuous. No helmets by choice =/= no helmets at all

The troops they are sending seem to be their best and soon they‚Äôll have depleted their special units to a point where. North Korea is vulnerable. I‚Äôd expect KJU to be reticent to send many more than about 20,000 in total.
==================================================
Its a good thing to surrender to Russia, North Korea, China and Iran besides more money for Israel to kill children
==================================================
North Koreans are unauthorized lol
==================================================
They only send 10k according to South-Korean MOD???
==================================================
I think the real news here is that the intelligence agencies of various states including South Korea believe fresh North Korean troops might arrive in Russia to assist in the Ukraine war within the next few months. North Korea has only sent 11,000 men or so, but that number could double soon.
==================================================
Ukraine really should just be Trianon-d with Poland getting the west, Russia getting the north and east and Moldova getting the south
==================================================
Weird. You mean after getting curbstomped to the point that small groups of North Koreans started going after Russians, the experiment has ended? Russia is done. They can do a lot more damage on the way out, but I just do not see any way for them to stop the bleeding at this point. Its only a matter of time before the rest of their empire starts crumbling.
==================================================
I hate to nitpick, but tariffs on North Korea would be physically impossible.

Excellent choices. Russia needs to treated like North Korea and IRAN since they are all best friends now.

Title is a mis-statement of the actual articles findings. ISW estimates Russian casualties are 30 to 45 thousand a month - among those losses is approx 4 thousand North Koreans of an estimated 11 to 12 thousand deployed. At the rate of current losses North Koreans casualties will be 100% by mid-April. Note: Casualties are killed, captured, and wounded - many of the wounded will be able to return to duty after a short period if they are even allowed to leave the front lines despite being wounded. So even if they reach 100% casualties there will still be North Koreans left on the front lines.

Ukrainians shouldve learned from the South Vietnamese, Afghanis, South Koreans, Cubans, etc. that America will abandon its proxy wars and leave its allies to die whenever its politically expedient to do so (unless their name is Israel). This really shouldnt be surprising to anyone.

Ukraine is like a DEATH FACTORY for the Russians and North Koreans ü•±üòÜüëç
