Not a time to push Putin paranoia. Trump is already doing it to the max. We do not want nuclear war in Ukraine It has never been closer. Putin has a bankrupt country a military that is questionable and failing support. Every Ukrainian drone burning Russian oil shows Putin has failed. This is dangerous. Ukraine has no choice but to push on the West needs to help but quietly.,4

"My dear compatriots,Today, I have the honor of announcing a pivotal moment in our nation‚Äôs history. I have signed, together with the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, a peace treaty that ends the conflict that has deeply scarred our people. While this treaty involves difficult concessions, it is a necessary step to stop the tragedy and prevent further unnecessary loss of life.The occupied territories will remain under Russian control. I know how painful this is. Yet, as your president, I must prioritize life, reconstruction, and our future over battles that would continue to weaken us.Our nation has endured immense suffering. Thousands of lives have been lost, brave men and women who gave everything to defend our homeland. This war has left deep scars, but it has not broken us. However, we must face the reality that our demographics have been significantly impacted. To ensure the vitality of our country, we must look beyond our borders and welcome new citizens.This is why we have signed agreements with countries like India and several African nations to encourage immigration and help rebuild our society. These newcomers, from Asia and Africa, will bring their talents, energy, and cultures. They will not replace what we have lost but will enrich our nation in new ways.In this transformation, Ukraine can become a model of diversity and openness. Far from diluting our identity, this diversity will enhance our resilience and prosperity. Each individual who chooses to call Ukraine home will be a gift to our country. Together, we will build a society where tolerance, solidarity, and hope overcome the wounds of war.This marks a turning point. Let us face the future with courage, welcome those who come, and believe in our strength to build a united and inclusive Ukraine.Slava Ukraini!",4

Putin will end his invasion if Trump doesnt suck his cock.Its shameful to watch the leader of the free world cave in to KGB midget",4

" will no longer front the lions share of aid to Ukraine, the Trump administration said today in a devastating blow to Kyiv that will pile pressure on Europe to fill the void.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Washington will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship with its allies, adding that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.In a boon for Vladimir Putin, he added that the United States would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal with Russia - one of the key security guarantees requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Hegseth also said that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect to return to a pre-war state, saying any peace process must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraines pre- borders is an unrealistic objective.The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe, full stop, he said. But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.Trump maintains that he is in talks with both Russia and Ukraine, and had floated the idea of trading aid for access to rare Ukrainian minerals. Speaking to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at the NATO HQ in Belgium, Hegseth sought to clarify President Donald Trumps positions on whether NATO should accept Ukraine as a member, the annexed portions of the country by Russia, and Europes role in Ukraines defense. Honesty will be our policy going forward, Hegseth stated during his speech to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.He repeated that Trump was committed to ending the war and bringing about a negotiated peace between Russia and Ukraine. The bloodshed must stop and this war must end, Hegseth said.",4

What new factual information would possibly cause someone to stop supporting Ukraine?,4
"Best result for Ukraine is that Trumps ego gets bruised by Putin. Everyone but Trump expects Putin to intellectually run circles around Trump but big Don, unsurprisingly, is yet to see it.",4
"Don‚Äôt depend on Trump for anything, he is just full of verbal bull*t as is Putin. The U.S. Republicans are lock-step with Trump‚Äôs authoritarian ways, none dare to challenge him, no guts, no glory. President Zelenskyy you are a decent, honorable man and this American continues to fully support you and the Ukrainian people. Good people all around this world want Russia out of all Ukraine‚Äôs land. Hopefully, in 2026 decent Americans will take back control of government, meanwhile we will resist and fight like hell.

Ukraine has no fighting age males left and all the women have been trafficked into foreign sex markets. It cant possibly be any more over than it is right now.,4
Not a time to push Putin paranoia. Trump is already doing it to the max. We do not want nuclear war in Ukraine It has never been closer. Putin has a bankrupt country a military that is questionable and failing support. Every Ukrainian drone burning Russian oil shows Putin has failed. This is dangerous. Ukraine has no choice but to push on the West needs to help but quietly.,4
"Trumps capitulation to RussiaPete Hegseth (head of the Pentagon):) a return to Ukraines  borders is unrealistic;) Ukraines membership in NATO is unrealistic;) Ukraine should receive a security guarantee in the form of European troops as peacekeeping forces. However, these forces should be sent to Ukraine NOT as a NATO mission, and therefore Article  should not apply to them.Lets be honest. With Trumps return, it was known that the US would want - in one way or another - to quickly end the war in Ukraine. However, no one expected Trump to adopt a policy of such large concessions to Putin. Because if we look at Hegseths declaration today, we have a complete US capitulation to Putin on the subject of Ukraine. Kiev will not join NATO and will not receive any security guarantees from the US. The Americans are shifting the burden of guarantees onto the Europeans, knowing full well that the Europeans themselves will not be able to offer Ukraine anything and there will be no European peacekeeping forces (without a NATO mandate).Except that - to paraphrase Marshal Foch - this is not peace. This is a ceasefire for  years, after which Ukraine will fall into the Russian orbit of influence. But Trump doesnt care. He wont be in power by then anyway, so it wont matter to him. At most - just like in the case of Afghanistan - he will pass the responsibility on to his successors (peace was good, only his successors were not able to enforce it).The biggest loser is of course Europe, which knew full well that the risk of Trumps return and the US-Russia agreement (over the heads of the Europeans) is very high. And we did nothing about it. Europe completely slept through the last  years. There were many pompous declarations (does anyone still remember Macrons announcements about introducing troops to Ukraine?), but their implementation is at a embarrassing level.",4
Fucking good. Keep it up Ukraine. At this rate in 6 months time they will have hit everyone. üòÄ,4
"Im rooting for Ukraine and want them to destroy or take as much as possible from Russia. Trouble is they have nukes and Ukraine doesnt.. Trump will meet with Putin and he will ask for his land back; The mofo is delusional. Fark that. Maybe he gets destroyed train tracks back. No major land, i.e. towns and cities. Basically, we need to get nukes to Ukraine or else US/Ukraine cant have REAL peace talks.",4
"Trump is Putin‚Äôs lap dog. He just cut all aid to Ukraine. If Trump REALLY wanted to end the war, he‚Äôd increase sanctions, increase aid to Ukraine and lead NATO in enforcing a no-fly zone over Eastern Ukraine.",4
"If the collective West fails to ensure Ukrainian military victory, then we may aswell throw out all of the Geneva conventions, The Hague etc. Should the Russian state continue to exist, then Ukraine needs to obtain nuclear weapons on its own to ensure it can destroy all Russian institutions and delete these scum.",4

Ukraine needs to settle with Putin. Give some land away. Accept defeat and save its young men‚Äôs live. I don‚Äôt think much would change for the Ukraines living in the border anyway.,4
Americans being slightly less delusional about how badly Ukraine is fairing in Joe Bidens Ukraine warA good start I guess.,4
why should i give a shit about Ukraine? they sent all their men to die for nothing. i guess some people got rich at least and some billions went missing.,4

SLAVA UKRAINI! Ukraine has the cojones to do what the EU is too cowardly to undertake!,4
"Then what the fk are us Europeans doing? It better be making a European alliance and sending in the troops. Russia cant use other countries military, its one thing getting weapons from them its another using a countries military, we need to start preparing and if putin keeps up this shit we end it. Iraq style, massive air attacks with multiple waves using all the different jets we have that are great at different missions. We take out comms, AA defence networks, airfields, command and control centres and main factories fora war effort. We rule the skies they either surrender or fire nukes. Either way fk putin we cant let that egotistical maniac have his way anymore. Also if the US doesnt want too, tough luck its us in Europe that should be more worried. Ukraine has done an absolutely amazing job, but theyve had to fight a military thats classed as one of the best and even so they have numbers, we need to help Ukraine proper. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åøü§ùüá∫üá¶",4

Putin would be crazy to stop without complete Ukranian surrender and zelensky being handed overNATO already showed their hand. They want Russian collapse and balkanization. Ukraine is the staging platform.Having any sort of peace will just let Ukraine build up their forces and try again,4
"Europeans dont understand why the world is so shitty right now. The world is shitty right now because America is overstretched and overburdened and it cant provide security while trying to babysit Europe. Europe is supposedly a developed continent and supposedly has technology and economy. So they should be providing their own security at the very least. Thats independent of NATO alliances, further it would only increase NATOs power overall if Europeans themselves put more money into defense. A good friend is one that doesnt allow other friends to carry their own burden. Being a leech to American military/economy isnt good for the future of NATO. That problem has been highlighted for the last + years, yet Europe refuse to do anything. The % self imposed goal was made  years ago as a bare minimum. Europeans seeing this as some sort of America bad is absolutely the wrong mentality. Ukraine is in Europe. Ukraine was destabalized by EU overthrowing the Ukraines Russian friendly leader and causing havoc to the region.",4

Ending the slaughter in Ukraine and stopping the hemorrhaging of life and money is not abandoning our allies. Poland is a part of NATO and would be protected by us. And honestly, after the performance in Ukraine, Im pretty sure Poland would be able to fend fairly well (not even considering all the aid they would get from the EU).If anything this peace will be a wake-up call for Europe as a whole, and they will learn that relying on the US to protect their entire continent is not a fair or good idea. They will get a little bit of nationalism back and actually build up their military and independence. Just a shame it took so much death for people to wake up.",4
