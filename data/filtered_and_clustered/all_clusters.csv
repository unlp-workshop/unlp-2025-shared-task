"When they attacked Ukrainian positions, the colonel said, Pyongyangs fighters sustained most of their casualties in the first few minutes of the assault. They repeatedly attack along the same routes where dozens of their troops have already been killed in action, Kindratenko said. Pyongyangs troops were very mobile, with some of the fighters shedding the protective gear Russia had provided, he said. In some instances, they operate without helmets or ballistic plates to increase speed during assaults on Ukrainian positions, Kindratenko said. Their confiscated backpacks held only scant food, a liter of water, and no cold-weather gear like gloves or thermal clothing. Most of the space in the Russian-issued backpacks is taken up by ammunition, the colonel said. North Korean troops have more than three times the number of magazines than the average Russian soldier carries, Kindratenko said, plus the supplies of grenades and landmines. Equipment recovered from the bodies of slain North Korean soldiers in Kursk indicate they are often better armed than Russian forces, the colonel added. The title seems a bit disingenuous. No helmets by choice =/= no helmets at all",0
"Its a good thing to surrender to Russia, North Korea, China and Iran besides more money for Israel to kill children",0
North Koreans are unauthorized lol,0
They only send 10k according to South-Korean MOD???,0
"Title is a mis-statement of the actual articles findings. ISW estimates Russian casualties are 30 to 45 thousand a month - among those losses is approx 4 thousand North Koreans of an estimated 11 to 12 thousand deployed. At the rate of current losses North Koreans casualties will be 100% by mid-April. Note: Casualties are killed, captured, and wounded - many of the wounded will be able to return to duty after a short period if they are even allowed to leave the front lines despite being wounded. So even if they reach 100% casualties there will still be North Koreans left on the front lines.",0
"I think the real news here is that the intelligence agencies of various states including South Korea believe fresh North Korean troops might arrive in Russia to assist in the Ukraine war within the next few months. North Korea has only sent 11,000 men or so, but that number could double soon.",0
Excellent choices. Russia needs to treated like North Korea and IRAN since they are all best friends now.,0
"The troops they are sending seem to be their best and soon they‚Äôll have depleted their special units to a point where. North Korea is vulnerable. I‚Äôd expect KJU to be reticent to send many more than about 20,000 in total.",0

Ukraine wanted to feel protected by nato a defense, not an offense pact, apparently that was a threat to russia. ukraine just wanted to choose their own path, something we tremendously respect, unlike russia. Also, unlike russians who change the history books to their liking, we do not forget about holodomor. yea, we wont forget about you fighting nazis  alongside the Ukrainian ssr, and the sacrifice russia made. But we also do not forget Molotov Ribbentrop.... russia was the nazi ally, do not fucking forgot that. russia was also the aggressor in the winter war with Finland. stalin and hitler were happy to carve up eastern europe between them. so yeah, we have many reasons NOT to trust the russians. russia was happy to be with hitler until the nazis decided to end the friendship. if that had not happened, you would still be friends with the nazis. from own experience i know how racist the moscow russians are. those that are in power for sure. again, reasona against liking the russians. theres your answer, go find yourself some proper history books. so yeah, fuck russia, fuck putin and have a nice day.",1

As US you should not be mad only know what to invest in from this speech...Some only as US big player...The no for Ukraine to NATO is normal as per conditions to join you must be in no conflict and have no border issue with other country...The % GDP for defense is only $ for big army contractors. See what to invest in ....Reduce reliance on Russia after the Ukraine special ops with the know how of CIA did to Nordstream... is like to say buy less fuel after buying a tesla EU need more fuel and get it at this time mostly from the US if there will be negotiations it could end in that EU go back to Russia gas and fuel...so down for US fuel companies,1
"If memory serves, part of what ended WWII for Germany Japan was their inability to get fuel to their planes/tanks/trucks/etc. At some point, if Ukraine can sustain this, Putins armies will lose mobility, armored support and air capabilities.

"Alexandra Prokopenko Putin Is Not Yet Desperate: Economic Pain Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine in Foreign Affairs: If Western capitals cannot bank on the imminent collapse of the Russian economy, they must face the reality that Russia will pose an immense challenge for the next year or more. The United States and Europe will need to sustain Ukraine through this critical period, working together to bolster sanctions enforcement and finding ways to manage potential shifts in U.S. policy or fractures within the European Union. Eventually, the cumulative toll of Russia‚Äôs war economy will need to be paid. The West should be planning for that contingency now in order to capitalize on the opportunity when economic collapse becomes an urgent, unavoidable reality for Putin. But Ukraine‚Äôs backers should not expect that moment to arrive any time soon. Richard Connolly Russias Wartime Economy isnt as Weak as it Looks for RUSI: Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, \the Russian economic system\ is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives. For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised.",1
Can you imagine working at an oil refinery in Russia right now. Fuck that.,1
"They have done their calculation and think keeping Ukraine off the NATO was an easy choice. Probably lot harder right now, but still likely is the right choice for them.

"Im a pro-Ukie hohol lover and this is my Trump-hating take:What does not returning to pre- mean? Recognition of Crimea as Russian? Giving them Donbas? Evacuating and even giving Russia the declared Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblast they dont even control but annexed anyway? Im % for a compromise and concession to Russia if the rest of the deal is stable. To me Crimea + Donbas (at least the part thats been under Russian rule) makes sense.No NATO is dodgy. Which countries and what agreement would that be thats stable enough to deter Russia? Im for it if its strong enough + has nuclear umbrella.% GDP spending is retarded. Like for all countries? USA spends % of GDP on military and they have such a large MIC they get massive benefits by selling to other countries and signing lasting diplomatic agreements through that support. I can % agree that at least the % should be met and there should be this joint effort to standardize and make the European defense more competent. Plenty of militaries like Germanys is a joke while Polands is pretty serious.EU needs to produce more energy uh, what? Less reliance on Russia is fine but not like all EU countries have access to good energy sources in most cases. But like I like the general initiative.Overall not the worst statement by Hegseth but it lacks substance or how they will enforce it. Right now it just looks like they took off the best offers for Ukraine, more pressure on EU to hate USA and then waffled in the air. So I guess well see how serious they are. Putin is probably just gonna say no and then theyll pretend they never said anything.",1
"After Russia finally looses Putins stupid war, it is going to take ALL the Billions of siezed Russian Assets and all the proceeds from all the sanctions against Russia for the next decade at least, to help rebuild those Ukrainian towns.

Way too many banks are either ignoring or circumventing the sanctions.,1
How about bring Russia Russia down by military force. Russia will never use nukes. Just like the old Nazis Russia must be taken down and neutralized.,1
Be great if they just keep hitting a new section every couple of days once they have repaired the one previous. I guess with such long lengths of over ground sections there will be nothing Russia can do to stop it. Well hey there‚Äôs some hopium.,1

The corresponding amendments to the Criminal Code (CC) authored by United Russia members Irina Yarovaya and Vasily Piskarev were approved the day before by the government commission on legislative activity, Kommersant reports. We are talking about the proposed abolition of the so-called principle of prejudice, when criminal liability for an offense occurs only after an administrative penalty. According to the draft law, this will affect, in particular, punishment under Article . of the Criminal Code (calls for the introduction of sanctions against the Russian Federation). If the accused supported anti-Russian restrictions for selfish motives or for hire, he will immediately receive a fine of  million to  million rubles or go to prison for up to five years (currently, the punishment involves a fine of up to  thousand rubles and imprisonment for up to three years).",1
Because youre letting Russia get away with a blatant land grab. This behavior is unacceptable and should be harshly punished. We should be completely barring all trade with them and sinking their shipping.,1

Way too many now ignoring or circumventing the sanctions.,1
And Ukraine has been independent for all of thirty years and spent twenty of those years demilitarizing their country.Thats not really an issue for Russia.

"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south.",1

"Alexandra Prokopenko Putin Is Not Yet Desperate: Economic Pain Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine in Foreign Affairs: If Western capitals cannot bank on the imminent collapse of the Russian economy, they must face the reality that Russia will pose an immense challenge for the next year or more. The United States and Europe will need to sustain Ukraine through this critical period, working together to bolster sanctions enforcement and finding ways to manage potential shifts in U.S. policy or fractures within the European Union. Eventually, the cumulative toll of Russia‚Äôs war economy will need to be paid. The West should be planning for that contingency now in order to capitalize on the opportunity when economic collapse becomes an urgent, unavoidable reality for Putin. But Ukraine‚Äôs backers should not expect that moment to arrive any time soon. Richard Connolly Russias Wartime Economy isnt as Weak as it Looks for RUSI: Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, \the Russian economic system\ is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives. For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised.",1

This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. ‚Ä¢ etc.",1

They got a chunk of it through glowie ops but couldnt take the rest in an open war, despite the SMO which went from  days to  years of conflict. Freezing the conflict entirely puts both Zelensky and Putin in a bad position and allows for regime change. The key word from Hegseth is honesty as in honest elections. Freeze the conflict and allow the Republics and whats left of Ukraine vote for new leaders. The Republics and Ukraine have both been run like police states up until this point and in all likelihood, theyd both vote to be one nation again. Putin doesnt want that, as it would undo everything hes been trying to accomplish since , it would be the end of his legacy and hed probably be killed. Zelensky doesnt want elections because he knows hes going to lose as well and be prosecuted for all the corruption hes engaged in up until this point.Russia is on the ropesThis isnt a movie. People are getting slaughtered on both sides for little gain but have sunk so much into the conflict that neither can stop. Russia can keep limping along for at least another year or two. Ukraine, perhaps another year. The Ukrainian defense will eventually break and Russia will take it but, it will be so bloody and costly that Russia will have almost completely depleted its military assets to do so. And Putin will inherit an insurgency in whats left of Ukraine on top of that.There is no winning this conflict for either side. Even if Ukraine pushed back all Russian forces tomorrow, they dont have the resources to fix whats broken in their country and will need aid. Better to freeze the war, let the nations vote for non-retarded leaders, and come to some kind of stable terms that will actually hold.",1

"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south.",1

"There are several other scenarios in which Putins stupid war in Ukraine could end: ‚Ä¢ Ukraine and the non-Ukrainian volunteers currently in Ukraine helping them kill Russian invaders with continued material assistance from NATO countries could exhaust the capacity of Putin to continue supporting his stupid war effort in Ukraine, and the Russian invaders could be pushed back out of all the Ukrainian territory they occupy. ‚Ä¢ Putin could be assassinated or die and his replacement could decide to stop fighting Putins stupid war. ‚Ä¢ The Russian military could decide it has had enough of Putins stupid war and they could overthrow Putin and his Kremlin cronies and then withdraw the remaining Russian military from Ukraine. ‚Ä¢ A country that borders on Ukraine, like Poland, that knows it could easily be Putins next target if Putin is allowed to conquor Ukraine, decides to use its military without invoking NATO assistance to help Ukraine push back the Russian invaders and their North Korean buddies. ‚Ä¢ Another country, like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, or even China, could take advantage of Russias current weakness and distraction with its war in Ukraine, to decided to take back some of their land that Russia currently occupies like the peninsula of Russia to the east of China, opening a second front for Russia, which causes Russia to divide its military, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied in Ukraine. ‚Ä¢ Trump decides that if he cant get Greenland hell take one or more of the islands above the arctic circle that Russia currently considers theirs. This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. ‚Ä¢ etc.",1

"Though I disagree with nothing said in the article after living and working there for 10 years... the premise is not at all correct. Russia invaded Ukraine for the simple fact that they were always going to take back the strategically important Crimean Peninsula and their long held port city and naval base at Sevastopol after the Soviet Union broke up... and in doing so, had no real choice but to attempt to create a land bride to Crimea... and knowing that all the rare earth minerals and gas fields were in the Donbass... they want to snatch that on the way by. Those outside of Russia have no idea what a massive slap in the face to Russia and their perceived sense of might it was when Ukraine said oh, you want to enter the base.... sorry, I dont see your name on the list The article is correct about the collective delusions and insecurity and how Russians cope with their past, how they rationalize violence and they are absolutely apathetic and indifferent to human suffering. But the reasons for Russias are very much rooted in practical military considerations. The reasons the population goes along with it particularly those over 40 are very much those expressed in the article. When I was 26, I was a consultant for a Russian/American joint venture in Russia in the mid / late 90s and guys would constantly and randomly blurt out facts about attack helicopters and MIGs and shit about them being the best in the world while were talking about what to eat for lunch or something completely inane. They are MASSIVELY insecure as a nation. They were told they were the greatest and the best for almost 80 years. Moscow was called Stolitsa Mira - The Capital of the World. Soviets were told day and night that they were the envy of the world and that everyone wanted to be them. They were told they had the worlds best tech, the worlds greatest military and the worlds strongest economy, had next to zero crime and that everything western represented everything wrong in the world. Then, they woke up and found out it was all a lie. Their life was a lie. Their very purpose in life was a lie. They found out they were 5 decades behind the rest of the world, that no one envied them and even worse... no one even thought about them at all. Forgetting about 2 Chechen wars, attacking Georgia, taking part of Moldova and 2014 attack on Ukraine... The last 25 years for Russia has been nothing but endless saber rattling, threats and demanding, but never earning respect.",1
"Love to see it, hate the pollution obviously but if this continues every day it surely starts impacting Putins power as the impact on so many aspects of the war and daily life mount for the military and the general population.

Any contracts you find can be FOIAd. Many companies do this to see what proposals look like for those that won contracts in the past. CC your local house of reprisentatives office as well to add more fuel to the fire. This is common practice in the competitive world of government contracting. Ive been learning about it for a few years now trying to win small trucking and shipping contracts for new small business startup and attended a lot of free seminars agencies put on for people to attend in person or virtually. Look up the rule of  for how big companies use small ones to win contracts by using the set-aside status of small companies to lock out competittion on contracts.,2

The Russians themselves do not see them as Russians, but as a people to be conquered and ultimately replaced. The Ukrainians need our help now more than ever. If we could ramp up support for another year or so maybe longer and outpace Russias incredibly slow production rates, they could be in a very untenable position. Getting Americans to support this very simple, economically sound strategy seems to be quite the uphill battle though. In 1-2 years, for pennies on the dollar, we could completely eliminate a major geopolitical foe from any degree of relevance for a decade at the least and refocus on China and the Pacific.

"What exactly do these figures refer to? To pure military deliveries? It looks like a naive calculation. If you think and calculate a little further, other countries look good, too. For example, almost 1.3 million Ukrainians live in Germany and have access to the entire social system.

For example, massive trade losses due to the boycott of Russian products and sanctions on Russia.",2

"It‚Äôs not quite that simple. As another anon said, left-wing violence has a dimmer switch and can be turned up or down nearly at will, but right-wing violence is more like a fuse box. It takes a while for it to break but once it does that shit isn‚Äôt coming back to normal for a long timeGlowniggers control left wing violence almost completely, that much is obvious from this data. What they absolutely fear is right wingers (% of people when you actually make following their true beliefs cost something) being pushed to the point where they feel nothing can be fixed without flying bullets and infrastructure sabotage. That is impossible to control and harder to predict who ends up ruling the ashes afterward.

Im a Russian-speaker and I know firsthand the people Putin is calling ethnic-Russians are definitely not Russians and for the most part have no desire to be so. The Russians themselves do not see them as Russians, but as a people to be conquered and ultimately replaced. The Ukrainians need our help now more than ever. If we could ramp up support for another year or so maybe longer and outpace Russias incredibly slow production rates, they could be in a very untenable position. Getting Americans to support this very simple, economically sound strategy seems to be quite the uphill battle though. In 1-2 years, for pennies on the dollar, we could completely eliminate a major geopolitical foe from any degree of relevance for a decade at the least and refocus on China and the Pacific. But it seems the Realists have convinced too many uninformed people that doing this is going to somehow strengthen China, who is betting on Russia and the very outcome that many MAGAts are calling for - a geographically split Ukraine with no security guarantees.",2

When you stand there, you cannot help but behold the miracle before you.It got me thinking about another miracle I hope all of you dont see as too far away.  was a miracle,  was a miracle,  was a miracle, , the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a miracle, and theres no reason why the miracle of the reestablishment of the Temple on the Temple Mount is not possible. I dont know how it would happen, you dont know how it would happen, but I know that it could happen, thats all I know, he said.A step in that process is the recognition that facts and activities on the ground truly matter.

When you stand there, you cannot help but behold the miracle before you.It got me thinking about another miracle I hope all of you dont see as too far away.  was a miracle,  was a miracle,  was a miracle, , the declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was a miracle, and theres no reason why the miracle of the reestablishment of the Temple on the Temple Mount is not possible. I dont know how it would happen, you dont know how it would happen, but I know that it could happen, thats all I know, he said.A step in that process is the recognition that facts and activities on the ground truly matter. Thats why going to visit Judea and Samaria, understanding that the very sovereignty over Israeli soil, cities, locations, is a critical next step to showing the world that this is the land for Jews, and the land of Israel, Hegseth concluded.",2

"GREGGPOSTING evening update for ... Messages are pouring into my messenger asking what I think about the latest incident with the phone call between Trump and Putin.. There are absolutely no NEGOTIATIONS taking place, these are supposed to take place between Ukraine and Russia. Trump is following a mediators work schedule where he first DISCUSSES with both parties to hear their demands and positions. It is the media that is currently magnifying the discussion by calling it NEGOTIATIONS. Of course Trump likes this media circus because he is in the spotlight.. Listen to the ENTIRE interview of the American envoy and the Minister of Defense, the media cuts where they want to get sensations. The media is probably not the one who decides about the negotiations. In this matter, the Finnish press has actually had more ice in its hat than the Swedish. For some reason, the media is not highlighting that we have more than  km of land in Kursk. Even Trump doesnt believe in just asking us to leave Kursk without compensation.We are far from a ceasefire, it will take months just to agree on an agenda for peace talks, and the EU will also have its say on it, especially since Trump is demanding that the EU cover the costs.In principle, nothing new is happening, talks have been going on behind the scenes for a long time already. The only new thing now is the media frenzy with loose comments and wild speculation. What we will see on the fronts now is an escalated Ukrainian activity that will culminate in a massive attack sometime in April.SLAVA UKRAINi",2

National leaders were present yesterday at the the 80th anniversary of the German atrocity at Auschwitz.

If the face of America becomes this narcissistic bully Trump, every peace securing multilateral alliance is weakened or gone. Were back to the early 20th century again in terms of how nations respect another. It would be just disastrous for US foreign policy 40 years ago, but now that we know more about anthropogenic climate change and its effects that extend thousands of years into the future, its suicidal for human civilization. To put this in perspective, the election of Trump reduced global human carrying capacity by about 1% going forward, for the next 5-9 thousand years. Meaning every Trump voter in effect murdered a future human being.",2

According to one of them, Putin is aware of the ‚Äúreally big problems‚Äù: trillion-dollar defense spending has driven up inflation, and an attempt to contain it by sharply raising rates has led to businesses, from small to large, having difficulty servicing their debts. According to CMACS estimates, every fifth industrial enterprise in the country is at risk, which promises a ‚Äújump in corporate bankruptcies‚Äù for the economy. ‚ÄúThe relatively prosperous period for the Russian economy, which was based on previously accumulated resources, is over,‚Äù notes Oleg Vyugin, former deputy chairman of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. At the end of , every fourth company faced a lack of working capital and the inability to obtain a loan, according to a survey by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

"Banks have begun to refuse loans to Russians en masse Russian banks have begun to refuse consumer loans to Russians en masse. In January, credit institutions approved only % of applications for consumer loans against % for the same period last year. This follows from data from the financial marketplace Sravni, which Izvestia cites. ‚Äú% is an unprecedented level of decline in the approval rate for at least the past few years,‚Äù said Magomed Gamzaev, director of the credit department at Sravni. Large banks confirmed to Izvestia the low level of approval of consumer loans in January of this year. According to preliminary data from Frank RG, in January, the total volume of loans issued (including mortgages, cash loans, car loans and POS loans) amounted to  billion rubles. ‚Äî this is the minimum result since April . The retail lending market cooled off last year due to the Central Banks tough policy, noted Alexey Volkov, Marketing Director of the National Bureau of Credit Histories. According to him, first of all, this is about raising the key rate to a record % and tightening quantitative restrictions on issuing loans to high-risk borrowers. Thus, on the one hand, the number of loan applications is decreasing, since the increase in rates forces many citizens to refuse to take out unsecured loans, and on the other hand, the approval rate for loan requests is also falling significantly. Thus, in December , this figure for unsecured loans was at the level of %, Volkov noted. The market expects that the high key rate will remain for a long time, so banks are tightening their lending policy and receiving target returns with a lower level of risk, says Ivan Uklein, Senior Director of Bank Ratings at Expert RA. He noted that against the backdrop of a slowdown in lending to individuals, financial institutions have increased their placements in deposits with the Central Bank and investments in securities.",2

You should be pulling data from future procurement spending on acquisition.gov and federal contracting opportunities (contracts) on SAM.GOV  looking at the GSA IDIQ contracting opportutnities too for those companies on the GSA schedule. Look up company CAGE codes which are administered by DLA and their SBA company profiles on SBA.GOV. Past contacts can be found on fpds.gov too. SAM.GOV and Im sure other also have an API you can use to pull data from if you login using your login.gov credentials (you should have these for doing taxes anyways with the IRS). HIGHERGOV and other sites like them just pool public facing data into reports. You dont need them really. ,2

If the face of America becomes this narcissistic bully Trump, every peace securing multilateral alliance is weakened or gone. Were back to the early 20th century again in terms of how nations respect another. It would be just disastrous for US foreign policy 40 years ago, but now that we know more about anthropogenic climate change and its effects that extend thousands of years into the future, its suicidal for human civilization. To put this in perspective, the election of Trump reduced global human carrying capacity by about 1% going forward, for the next 5-9 thousand years.

"My vote for dumbest trade wars are as follows: Pastry War 1838-1839: This conflict began when a French pastry chef, Remontel, asked the Mexican government to pay damages after his shop was destroyed by a mob. When the Mexican government ignored his request, Remontel asked the French government for help. Ten years later, King Louis-Philippe of France demanded Mexico pay Remontel, including a 90% interest rate. When Mexico refused, France blockaded Mexico and occupied Veracruz. Kettle War 1784: This war started when the Holy Roman Emperor wanted ports in the southern Netherlands open to trade via the River Scheldt. Instead of negotiating, the emperor sent a flotilla of ships, including the flagship Le Louis. The Dutch responded with a single ship, the Dolfijn, which fired one shot at Le Louis, hitting a soup kettle. The flagship surrendered immediately, and the war ended. Jenkins Ear War 1739-1748: The war began after a British trader, Robert Jenkins, had his ear cut off by Spanish authorities in 1731. Eight years later, the British used this incident as an excuse to force Spain out of the Caribbean and South America. The war saw 25,000 dead or wounded and nearly 5,000 ships lost, but the conflict was overshadowed by the War of Austrian Succession. Dumb enough for you?",3
I hope Putin ends the war. He actually has the power to do so. :,3
"Putins ego is soo big that he will never do such a thing. He will never admit that hes being defeated either. Or that his country is losing hundreds of thousands of soliders over this war. Putin will only negotiate if the deal makes Russia come out on top. Even with trump being president now, hes not going to negotiate with trump unless Russia gets the upper hand out of the deal. He will take nothing less. Thats just how he is. I think its going to take Ukraine giving up a lot more terrority then it wants for this war to end. And Putin wont stop until he gets that. Ukraine just needs to take an L on this one and give up some territory to stop hundreds of thousands more people losing their lives over a war that is over land.",3

"Like you Im heartbroken that the world isnt doing enough for Ukraine even when Russia are committing atrocities on a near daily basis. However I think youre a little misguided if you think there really consequences for those in the US and UK? OK, there are instances of outrage from time to time, and in some specific cases - usually where orders were being ignored - individuals are prosecuted but war crimes committed through the chain of command? Rarely if ever prosecuted in US/UK, although UK does from time to time prosecute decades after the event as attitudes have changed. This seems to be especially true in US where they have refused to sign up to many of the conventions related to banned weapons in the first place, they dont recognise the ICC and they are not even full signatories of the Geneva convention they exclude Protocols I, II. All things they have in common with Russia. The US doesnt even consider many things as war crimes if they are perpetrated by their own armed forces yet they go after others for the same actions. How many members of the US military were held accountable for the slaughter of civilians in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflicts? They have even abused concepts such as illegal combatants to get around laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. In truth, I think this is the primary reason that many, the US especially doesnt challenge Russia on their war crimes because they are worried about the fingers that would be pointed back at them.",3

Ukrainians were facing extermination from the Russians when the Germans arrived during the war. The only logical thing to do was join the Germans. When the war ended ukranians fighting in allied armies That is British and US were forced back to Soviet occupied Ukraine. They faced a minimum of twenty years in a penal colony where five year sentence was considered a death sentence. at least 6000 American prisoners of war liberated by the Russians were marched into the Russian penal colonies and given twenty year sentences. Bandura had no choice but to fight.,3

The US desperately wanted this war though because they foolishly believed they could hurt Russia and possibly replace their government with some puppet regime and resume the strip mining operation that Putin stopped. All those deaths and the loss of territory is on us, completely avoidable but our elites are inbred retards incapable of managing an empire.",3

"My vote for dumbest trade wars are as follows: Pastry War 1838-1839: This conflict began when a French pastry chef, Remontel, asked the Mexican government to pay damages after his shop was destroyed by a mob. When the Mexican government ignored his request, Remontel asked the French government for help. Ten years later, King Louis-Philippe of France demanded Mexico pay Remontel, including a 90% interest rate. When Mexico refused, France blockaded Mexico and occupied Veracruz. Kettle War 1784: This war started when the Holy Roman Emperor wanted ports in the southern Netherlands open to trade via the River Scheldt. Instead of negotiating, the emperor sent a flotilla of ships, including the flagship Le Louis. The Dutch responded with a single ship, the Dolfijn, which fired one shot at Le Louis, hitting a soup kettle. The flagship surrendered immediately, and the war ended. Jenkins Ear War 1739-1748: The war began after a British trader, Robert Jenkins, had his ear cut off by Spanish authorities in 1731. Eight years later, the British used this incident as an excuse to force Spain out of the Caribbean and South America. The war saw 25,000 dead or wounded and nearly 5,000 ships lost, but the conflict was overshadowed by the War of Austrian Succession. Dumb enough for you?",3
Those would be called non-starters because thats what they are. Not even open for conversation. If you didnt get the memo this isnt a negociation. The war is over. The ukies got slayed. This is a capitulation. They will be carved up for their until the last ukie strategy. Pull your head out of your ass.,3

"Its from more than  years ago. Still interesting from an historical perspective but quite outdated.Youd be amazed at how much doesnt change. For example, if you watch Tantura, an HONEST israeli documentary about the  Nakba and all the genocidal war crimes. It has a gorillion parallels to today even down to the  IDF/mossad historical document, which outlines exactly how to do israeli propaganda  evidence suppression. Although things have changed via the methods, like electronic vs paper/film, social media vs MSM . The core tactics involved remain unchanged. Such as destroying all evidence before it leaves the borders of isreael  banning any journalists that expose unapproved evidence. Or like how their war tactic is always terrorist genocidal war crimes, which they intentionally spread in the media. Always having IDF target civilians. To cause the natives of the land to flee, after being terrorized at what theyve viewed. Israel then steals this land, doesnt allow the natives to return, and then expands their borders to make these borser towns part of israelOr like how they use hollywood studios to create false propaganda, to coverup their genocidal war crimes. Like using Goldwyn Mayer to make a fake documentary about the  ethical and moral war. Despite it being filmed  days after the war ended (ie. IDF going village to village and committing genocidal war crimes against civilians- but spinning it as a war of IDF vs a Palestinian military). It painted it as the natives willingly leaving, vs fleeing for their lives or being raped and then slaughteted. With many towns fleeing before IDF even came, already knowing what would happen if they didnt. Kikes also used Hollywood director Wilds to create a fake propaganda documentary about the liberation of the nazi concentration camps. Which even anne franks sister in law, eva schloss, admitted was a fraud on the ABC morning show. Filmed months later by the russian govt",3
lolUkraine just lost the war and you tranny faggots are still talking about cope and seethe,3
That means Russian conditions will be metThat has fuck all to do with anything. Ukraines ability to fight the war is entirely contingent upon US military aid. Its over. No more dollarydoos. Cope and seethe and kill yourselves you fucking nihilistic pieces of shit.,3

This is so embarrassing. The war could have ended about a year ago if the West had not consistently failed to provide the necessary amount of weapons at all times. It is a disgrace.,3

Ukrainians were facing extermination from the Russians when the Germans arrived during the war. The only logical thing to do was join the Germans. When the war ended ukranians fighting in allied armies That is British and US were forced back to Soviet occupied Ukraine. They faced a minimum of twenty years in a penal colony where five year sentence was considered a death sentence. at least 6000 American prisoners of war liberated by the Russians were marched into the Russian penal colonies and given twenty year sentences. Bandura had no choice but to fight.,3
No. Im tired of it. War is bad. Russia is bad. But if its not over by now its time to give up or find a resolution. Too much death already on both sides.,3

"My dear compatriots,Today, I have the honor of announcing a pivotal moment in our nation‚Äôs history. I have signed, together with the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, a peace treaty that ends the conflict that has deeply scarred our people. While this treaty involves difficult concessions, it is a necessary step to stop the tragedy and prevent further unnecessary loss of life.The occupied territories will remain under Russian control. I know how painful this is. Yet, as your president, I must prioritize life, reconstruction, and our future over battles that would continue to weaken us.Our nation has endured immense suffering. Thousands of lives have been lost, brave men and women who gave everything to defend our homeland. This war has left deep scars, but it has not broken us. However, we must face the reality that our demographics have been significantly impacted. To ensure the vitality of our country, we must look beyond our borders and welcome new citizens.This is why we have signed agreements with countries like India and several African nations to encourage immigration and help rebuild our society. These newcomers, from Asia and Africa, will bring their talents, energy, and cultures. They will not replace what we have lost but will enrich our nation in new ways.In this transformation, Ukraine can become a model of diversity and openness. Far from diluting our identity, this diversity will enhance our resilience and prosperity. Each individual who chooses to call Ukraine home will be a gift to our country. Together, we will build a society where tolerance, solidarity, and hope overcome the wounds of war.This marks a turning point. Let us face the future with courage, welcome those who come, and believe in our strength to build a united and inclusive Ukraine.Slava Ukraini!",4

" will no longer front the lions share of aid to Ukraine, the Trump administration said today in a devastating blow to Kyiv that will pile pressure on Europe to fill the void.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that Washington will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship with its allies, adding that Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.In a boon for Vladimir Putin, he added that the United States would not deploy troops to Ukraine under any peace deal with Russia - one of the key security guarantees requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Hegseth also said that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to expect to return to a pre-war state, saying any peace process must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraines pre- borders is an unrealistic objective.The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe, full stop, he said. But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.Trump maintains that he is in talks with both Russia and Ukraine, and had floated the idea of trading aid for access to rare Ukrainian minerals. Speaking to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at the NATO HQ in Belgium, Hegseth sought to clarify President Donald Trumps positions on whether NATO should accept Ukraine as a member, the annexed portions of the country by Russia, and Europes role in Ukraines defense. Honesty will be our policy going forward, Hegseth stated during his speech to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.He repeated that Trump was committed to ending the war and bringing about a negotiated peace between Russia and Ukraine. The bloodshed must stop and this war must end, Hegseth said.",4

"Trumps capitulation to RussiaPete Hegseth (head of the Pentagon):) a return to Ukraines  borders is unrealistic;) Ukraines membership in NATO is unrealistic;) Ukraine should receive a security guarantee in the form of European troops as peacekeeping forces. However, these forces should be sent to Ukraine NOT as a NATO mission, and therefore Article  should not apply to them.Lets be honest. With Trumps return, it was known that the US would want - in one way or another - to quickly end the war in Ukraine. However, no one expected Trump to adopt a policy of such large concessions to Putin. Because if we look at Hegseths declaration today, we have a complete US capitulation to Putin on the subject of Ukraine. Kiev will not join NATO and will not receive any security guarantees from the US. The Americans are shifting the burden of guarantees onto the Europeans, knowing full well that the Europeans themselves will not be able to offer Ukraine anything and there will be no European peacekeeping forces (without a NATO mandate).Except that - to paraphrase Marshal Foch - this is not peace. This is a ceasefire for  years, after which Ukraine will fall into the Russian orbit of influence. But Trump doesnt care. He wont be in power by then anyway, so it wont matter to him. At most - just like in the case of Afghanistan - he will pass the responsibility on to his successors (peace was good, only his successors were not able to enforce it).The biggest loser is of course Europe, which knew full well that the risk of Trumps return and the US-Russia agreement (over the heads of the Europeans) is very high. And we did nothing about it. Europe completely slept through the last  years. There were many pompous declarations (does anyone still remember Macrons announcements about introducing troops to Ukraine?), but their implementation is at a embarrassing level.",4

Ukraine is not allowed to join NATO or the EU for  years. NATO is not allowed to expand and needs to reverse the membership of Finland, Sweden and the Baltic‚Äôs NATOs military will be serverly reduced and not allowed to intervene NATOs influence and power will be reduced Russia gets to keep the land they took Putin gets to sell this as a win that be got the West to bend down to his willZelensky? Was this all worth it?  years of fighting, Millions dead/displaced, Billions wasted. For what?If Ukraine had surrendered day- this could all have been avoided. This whole war has shown, the one willing to use power and ignore the rules...win at the end of the day",4
"All that money and hardware earmarked for Ukraine is now going straight to Israel, where it rightfully belongs. Thanks goyim!",4
"Yes, Ukraine deserves to be liberated by all means possible. üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶",4
ZIGGERS CANNOT STOP DYING IN UKRAINE ;D,4
I‚Äôm from Appalachia and I say lol fuck Ukraine,4
"Absolutely. In fact, it concerns me a bit that people have forgotten about Ukraine because of the conflict in Gaza. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think it‚Äôs important too, but at the same time we can‚Äôt forget about continuing to support Ukraine‚Äôs fight against Russia.",4
Without question. UKRAINE FOREVER ‚ù§Ô∏è,4
"Ukraine was destabalized by EU overthrowing the Ukraines Russian friendly leaderThat was your out of control jewry, you retard, along with their euro puppets",4
"He just froze US aid to Ukraine, as an American I have to say its time for yall to wake up and understand that you can no longer count on us. Find other sources of aid, this man has already betrayed you.",4
"What an example of bravery, leadership and courage. These are the real life heroes. Glory to Ukraine!",4
"Attaboy! Another BBQ, keep it going Ukraine!",4
ukraine only had a purpose for our corrupt politicians and banking elite.There are no interests the American people have in ukraine.,4
Nigga this war wouldve been over but BIDEN OVERREACH has put us and Ukraine in a worse situation. it is literally all the fault of the Globalists that this deal had to go the way it did.,4
"This isnt news. Theyve been punting on the question of Ukraine joining NATO since . It was never going to happen and this point has been reiterated over and over again, even by Zelensky three years back. NATO expansion was never a legitimate security concern and this war has nothing to do with it.",4
"Thats the way to go putin wants to destroy Ukraines power grid, whats good for the goose is good for the gander for ever strike Russia does send 10 drones back on their power grid SLAVA UKRAINE üá∫üá¶ üáÆüá™",4
"If Ukraine had nuclear weapons wed literally be engulfed in a third world war right now, or living out the aftermath of nuclear strikes.",4
Rest in peace all of you innocent Ukrainians who has lost their lives. Glory to the heroes defending Ukraine.,4
"Yes, Ukraine deserves to be liberated by all means possible. üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶",4
Yes I do! Just submitted my monthly $500 to Ukraine since few months started war. Always support Ukraine for their freedom!,4
"Fuck, I‚Äôd just hand Ukraine all the money.",4
"Absolutely. I haven‚Äôt changed my fb profile pic from the main headline of ‚ÄúRussia attacks Ukraine‚Äù since 2022. I feel is the absolute least I can to do remind myself and anyone else that interacts with me of what‚Äôs going on half way across the world. Everything I see here is very sobering. I made a post way back then attempt to acknowledge why I don‚Äôt go fight. For better or worse: - I don‚Äôt know the land climate, and barely know the culture - I don‚Äôt speak Russian, Ukrainian, or any Slavic language - I‚Äôm not a soldier Of any of the above were true, then I might have gone, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs not. Sure, I could learn‚Ä¶ but that would take time, and that‚Äôs not what they need right now‚Ä¶ so I have to believe I‚Äôll be of more use some other way: controlling what I can in my sphere of orbit and vocally supporting Ukraine whenever possible. Slava Ukraini.",4
Much love respect from üá∫üá∏... slava Ukraine üá∫üá¶,4
Ukraine can certainly make nukes in no time! Do it!,4
This is David and Goliath and we know who won that Slav Ukraine,4
This funding of Ukraine has gone on long enough. Every taxpayer dollar sent to Ukraine is a dollar that could have been gifted to Israel. Thankfully Trump will right the wrongs of the past  years and resume paying Israel what it‚Äôs owed with interest.,4
Nigga this war wouldve been over but BIDEN OVERREACH has put us and Ukraine in a worse situation. it is literally all the fault of the Globalists that this deal had to go the way it did.,4
"Hey man, thats not before. Did I go off your retarded brown pajeet script where you have no answer as to why, or showing by any measure at all, that the US was funding a color revolution so that the EU makes money, before it actually happened?In reality, shitskinned pajeet, it was just oligarchs fighting with each other and stepping on each others territory, and the EU being retarded as usual. The US came in to try and mop up the EUs mess, despite the fact that the EU prevented Ukraine from joining NATO.",4
To those brave soldiers of Ukraine - we didn‚Äôt want this. So please accept my apologies for this disgusting common now decision. Loyalty isn‚Äôt a concept of the GOP.,4
Tick tock hoholsI wonder what everyone who collaborated with zelensky is going to be tried forYou betrayed Ukraine,4
The US are not in a position to keep funding Ukraine.,4
The European coalition supporting Ukraine is now totally coming apart.,4
Time to throw out ussr book and any influence as if it never happened need a new Ukraine on all levels,4
i am sure Ukraine would not mind having that shit in their cells... it would actually be punishment... Finland is too civilised.,4
Kursk isnt a part of the deal.Kursk was never going to be allowed to be a bargaining chip. The piggies were always going to leave the same way they came in.Ukraine will give up land in return for a ceasefire and an end to hostilities.,4
"If the collective West fails to ensure Ukrainian military victory, then we may aswell throw out all of the Geneva conventions, The Hague etc. Should the Russian state continue to exist, then Ukraine needs to obtain nuclear weapons on its own to ensure it can destroy all Russian institutions and delete these scum.",4
I could totally see a situation where China tries to go in and buy up all of the destroyed areas of Ukraine in order to grow wheat and ship it back to China.,4
Yes I support Ukraine absolutely and without wavering.,4
"I get the message, but this guy is considered to be a clown even in Ukraine.",4
Ukraine needs manpower much more than equipment! They cant even hold defensive lines anymore.,4
Too many Europeans are nw turning against Ukraine.,4
Its over you lying nigger. Ukraine lost and theres absolutely nothing you can do about it.,4
One million is coming fast! Thanks UKRAINE !,4

Ukraine outlived her purpose for the USA.,4
"Its okay , i posted a lone unarmed pow getting drone-gored in k again, the Ukraine is winnning",4
As much as I support my own Country Canada I support Ukraine 100% with my dieing breath I will support them,4
i am sure Ukraine would not mind having that shit in their cells... it would actually be punishment... Finland is too civilised.,4
"Why did Poland push for regime change in Ukraine, during the Maidan, so hard?",4
They are exactly halving the aid to Ukraine‚Ä¶?!,4
"no , I cant ,to much is wrong with the elected Government .So Ill stand here alone ,just be careful Im part Ukraine yeah wow hey .",4
A real war against NATO goes nuclear. Putins final card is a nuclear tactical weapon. Against Ukraine not an insurmountable problem . If it is against NATO its Armageddon. there is a dance here and Putins economy is. Destroyed. What does he have left?,4
"Merz must first return all his bribes and afd borrowed talking points. Dont believe or trust that guy, he is not interested in Ukraine, Germany or Europe.",4
The best way for Germany to keep the ruZZian army at a safe distance is to provide the long range weapons that Ukraine needs.,4
"The nationalist brigade are a separate fighting force then the ukrainian army. They have their own financing, their own recruitment and most importantly their own training and bases. They have permanent presence in Kharkov, Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Odessa and of course Western Ukraine. Their total number is probably between -  serving as fighters, plus a few hundred thousand as sympathizers and logistics. If the peace deal creates a Ukraine in which they can no longer exist they will most certinally rebel, because they will simply have no where to go.",4
Not a time to push Putin paranoia. Trump is already doing it to the max. We do not want nuclear war in Ukraine It has never been closer. Putin has a bankrupt country a military that is questionable and failing support. Every Ukrainian drone burning Russian oil shows Putin has failed. This is dangerous. Ukraine has no choice but to push on the West needs to help but quietly.,4
"Is there is even 30,000 in Ukraine right now?",4
