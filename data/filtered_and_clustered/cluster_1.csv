I remember early in the war the trolls were trying to say Ukraine killed many russians out of Reprisals. They could only name one victim and his murderer had a trial and went to jail. They never can definitively give an identity of someone who was murdered in such a way... Meanwhile Ukraine has a long list of victims with corpses and identities. Russia sucks... fuck Russia,1

France (the largest) only has , with an utterly dysfunctional legislature. Theyll throw you under the bus. The rest of the EU military is moribund barring Poland. Accept reality, youll be torn to shreds if it is what they want. Russia in reality likely doesnt want all of Europe, but if America detached themselves then the EU entire credibility collapses as Russia plucks off the Baltics, Finland, Poland.

"Alexandra Prokopenko Putin Is Not Yet Desperate: Economic Pain Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine in Foreign Affairs: If Western capitals cannot bank on the imminent collapse of the Russian economy, they must face the reality that Russia will pose an immense challenge for the next year or more. The United States and Europe will need to sustain Ukraine through this critical period, working together to bolster sanctions enforcement and finding ways to manage potential shifts in U.S. policy or fractures within the European Union. Eventually, the cumulative toll of Russia’s war economy will need to be paid. The West should be planning for that contingency now in order to capitalize on the opportunity when economic collapse becomes an urgent, unavoidable reality for Putin. But Ukraine’s backers should not expect that moment to arrive any time soon. Richard Connolly Russias Wartime Economy isnt as Weak as it Looks for RUSI: Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, \the Russian economic system\ is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives. For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised.",1
Can you imagine working at an oil refinery in Russia right now. Fuck that.,1
"They have done their calculation and think keeping Ukraine off the NATO was an easy choice. Probably lot harder right now, but still likely is the right choice for them.

We live in an unperfect fallen world princessThats no reason to do basic shit that costs us nothing to make the world less imperfect. A weakened Russia is even in our own economic interests.,1
Im rooting for Ukrainian terrorists worldwide. Ill donate $ to Sternenko sometime today. Maybe well end up with based ultranationalist and far-right terrorists in Europe and Russia.,1
"There are several other scenarios in which Putins stupid war in Ukraine could end: • Ukraine and the non-Ukrainian volunteers currently in Ukraine helping them kill Russian invaders with continued material assistance from NATO countries could exhaust the capacity of Putin to continue supporting his stupid war effort in Ukraine, and the Russian invaders could be pushed back out of all the Ukrainian territory they occupy. • Putin could be assassinated or die and his replacement could decide to stop fighting Putins stupid war. • The Russian military could decide it has had enough of Putins stupid war and they could overthrow Putin and his Kremlin cronies and then withdraw the remaining Russian military from Ukraine. • A country that borders on Ukraine, like Poland, that knows it could easily be Putins next target if Putin is allowed to conquor Ukraine, decides to use its military without invoking NATO assistance to help Ukraine push back the Russian invaders and their North Korean buddies. • Another country, like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, or even China, could take advantage of Russias current weakness and distraction with its war in Ukraine, to decided to take back some of their land that Russia currently occupies like the peninsula of Russia to the east of China, opening a second front for Russia, which causes Russia to divide its military, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied in Ukraine. • Trump decides that if he cant get Greenland hell take one or more of the islands above the arctic circle that Russia currently considers theirs. This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. • etc.",1
Gotta be Canada. 3rd largest Ukrainian population in the world outside of Ukraine and Russia.,1
Only Russia could have defeated the nazis in . Only Russia could have defeated nato in . Amazing record.,1
Well if Russia fucked off there would be no need for them!,1
Pretty easy to MMQB that decision. Russia literally agreed to the Budapest Memo.,1

This is the future of russia. Zelensky is not going anywhereYoure a faggot.,1
3 day became 3 years + . Fuck Russia.,1
Russia isnt Americas enemy.Nigga do you even watch Russian media? Lol We are % their enemy,1
And the US isnt in a position to cancel talks if Russia refuses and just keep funding Ukraine? Are you retarded?,1
Time to expand the list. If you are Russia you are on it until further notice.,1
SO RUSSIA IS GOING TO LOSE AND ISNT GOING TO GET UKRAINE THANKS FOR ADMITTING ;,1
"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south.",1
"except the Russian economy is booming (as long as gas and oil prices stay high) and thier army is larger than ever.Russia : $/mm shellNATO: ,$/mm shellit is impossible for ukraine to win since this has been an artillery war",1
"The king of Odessa! This is what ive said since 2022. Russia is god at two tings. Lying and propaganda. We should already have Nato troops pushing Russia out of Ukraine by now. Russias economy was as small as Spain Before the war now they have 21% inflation. That said we should just crush Russia, their economy is so small that it will not hurt the west and they will NEVER use Nukes! We did it in 1945, let us stop evil one more time!",1
"So we are supposed to give up our national territory, vow never to join NATO no matter what Russia does to us, AND also give Donald Trump our rare earth metals?",1
"if russia had not taken crimea and ukraine had invaded russia, we might have been on Russias side. .. likely we would not have intervened ar all. we hate it when peaceful countries get invaded. we do not like aggressors and we do not like bullies. Ukraine wanted to feel protected by nato a defense, not an offense pact, apparently that was a threat to russia. ukraine just wanted to choose their own path, something we tremendously respect, unlike russia. Also, unlike russians who change the history books to their liking, we do not forget about holodomor. yea, we wont forget about you fighting nazis  alongside the Ukrainian ssr, and the sacrifice russia made. But we also do not forget Molotov Ribbentrop.... russia was the nazi ally, do not fucking forgot that. russia was also the aggressor in the winter war with Finland. stalin and hitler were happy to carve up eastern europe between them. so yeah, we have many reasons NOT to trust the russians. russia was happy to be with hitler until the nazis decided to end the friendship. if that had not happened, you would still be friends with the nazis. from own experience i know how racist the moscow russians are. those that are in power for sure. again, reasona against liking the russians. theres your answer, go find yourself some proper history books. so yeah, fuck russia, fuck putin and have a nice day.",1

ITT: JIFD playing lets you and him fight between Russia and Poland,1
"If memory serves, part of what ended WWII for Germany Japan was their inability to get fuel to their planes/tanks/trucks/etc. At some point, if Ukraine can sustain this, Putins armies will lose mobility, armored support and air capabilities.

Russia is anachronistic empire and needs to be broken up into smaller countries.,1
He said Russia.. would struggle to fight against thirty-three countries not three. Hes talking about NATO getting their fucking act together and making retreat an easy decision for the creepy little Russian dictator that loves playing with dolls so much.,1
Tsar Putin has completely put Russia into a manure heap of failure Whilst Ukraine has proved to be a superb ally for West Europe.,1
"Don’t negotiate, Putin. Just take the land.Here is what I will do to Russia if it does not take the land:I will send such a blight upon Russia’s food stocks that the people starve. This will lead to mass revolts, a collapse of the Moscow government Chechnya breaking away, and the Far East being taken by China.",1
As US you should not be mad only know what to invest in from this speech...Some only as US big player...The no for Ukraine to NATO is normal as per conditions to join you must be in no conflict and have no border issue with other country...The % GDP for defense is only $ for big army contractors. See what to invest in ....Reduce reliance on Russia after the Ukraine special ops with the know how of CIA did to Nordstream... is like to say buy less fuel after buying a tesla EU need more fuel and get it at this time mostly from the US if there will be negotiations it could end in that EU go back to Russia gas and fuel...so down for US fuel companies,1
"NATO/Eu should change their policy to be tougher: ie Any vessel wanting to travel to/from Russia via Baltic Sea must: 1. Be escorted by NATO piloted vessel; 2. Have members of NATO pilot crew on board; 3. Have full shipping insurance acceptable to EU that includes damage to submarine facilities and new terms covering passage through Baltic Sea; 4. Pay an escort fee to cover all extra costs of monitoring and escort throughout passage and any moorage that is non refundable, payment no less than one month prior to proposed passage; 5. Submit a holding fee, not less than one month before passage, to cover potential costs of damages fee to be no less than $ 50 Million; returnable less interest, if no damages caused, no sooner than two months after passage; 6. Agree to all directions given by EU/NATO, failure to do so can be deemed criminal act of terrorism and all measures can be used by EU/NATO in response, no less than seizure of crew, vessel and all cargo, the full holding fee and criminal prosecutions as appropriate. 7. Moreover, any failure to comply with pilot directions and control measures can result in suspension of all movement of vessels to/from Russia via Baltic. All vessels in passage will be seized and held in EU port areas and special moorage charges will be applied to the holding fee as non returnable; and 8. Any vessel transiting the Baltic Sea to/from Russia that fails to follow the above agreement in full or in part can be deemed to be committing an act of terrorism and it and its crew can be treated accordingly, including the use of force by NATO.",1

It is especially funny that the Finland flag anon from DPR now has to prepare his anus. His homeland is about become Russia.,1
"Ok.Yes I also think Russia will not agree to line freeze, and want more oblasts. But the problem is Rus MoD is very slow. How long would it actually take to reach Krematorsk and Sloviyansk? ? I guess it depends how fast KGB thinks AFU will collapse with  burger support.",1
3 day became 3 years + . Fuck Russia.,1

"With every tax dollar Ive contributed since 1990. Growing up I was taught that Russia was the enemy, and all the money we spent on defense was spent to combat Russia. Now that that money is going toward its original intended use Im totally happy about that.",1
"Im a pro-Ukie hohol lover and this is my Trump-hating take:What does not returning to pre- mean? Recognition of Crimea as Russian? Giving them Donbas? Evacuating and even giving Russia the declared Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblast they dont even control but annexed anyway? Im % for a compromise and concession to Russia if the rest of the deal is stable. To me Crimea + Donbas (at least the part thats been under Russian rule) makes sense.No NATO is dodgy. Which countries and what agreement would that be thats stable enough to deter Russia? Im for it if its strong enough + has nuclear umbrella.% GDP spending is retarded. Like for all countries? USA spends % of GDP on military and they have such a large MIC they get massive benefits by selling to other countries and signing lasting diplomatic agreements through that support. I can % agree that at least the % should be met and there should be this joint effort to standardize and make the European defense more competent. Plenty of militaries like Germanys is a joke while Polands is pretty serious.EU needs to produce more energy uh, what? Less reliance on Russia is fine but not like all EU countries have access to good energy sources in most cases. But like I like the general initiative.Overall not the worst statement by Hegseth but it lacks substance or how they will enforce it. Right now it just looks like they took off the best offers for Ukraine, more pressure on EU to hate USA and then waffled in the air. So I guess well see how serious they are. Putin is probably just gonna say no and then theyll pretend they never said anything.",1
"101% to the end. Nearly regardless of how things play out. Who are any of the rest of the World to gripe given all the ridiculous corruption in the USA, China and Russia - regardless of “side” one takes. Russia invaded the sovereign territory of their neighbor with false claims. Putin is a POS and the people of Ukraine do not deserve the evils inflicted upon them. Slava Ukraini und Heroyam Slava!",1

"China isnt going to undermine its own relationship with Russia to help the EU. Russia ensures them cheap energy and food. Europe is farther, at best theyll do some modest economic cooperation. A Russia that wins in Ukraine and absorbs the Ukranian Army can and will steamroll Europe. Barring Poland, the neglect of military in the continent is near total. Even France and UK cut it back due to their long standing austerity retardation.",1
Pretty easy to MMQB that decision. Russia literally agreed to the Budapest Memo.,1
I wonder why all the nations next to russia want to join nato. must be the jews,1
Whats the point of the peace deal for Ukraine if Russia just rolls over them in few years?,1
Way too many now ignoring or circumventing the sanctions.,1

"No European country nor the USA has fought a peer conflict in over  years. Your forces are completely untested.

the US has abandoned Europe to non-Whitethe US through its military and intelligence apparatus has demanded Europe be lead only by people who will execute European nations with non-Whites invasions.

Russia that wins in Ukraine and absorbs the Ukranian Army can and will steamroll Europe.Lmao you mutts really do believe this dont you? Youre fucking retarded,1
We have to seek war with Russia because they have nukesThey will never attack either EU or NATO soil. Nukes are a last resource. Theyll be hit back and they know.Literally anything other than actively seeking war with Russia will work fine,1
"Yes Im not sure what more America can sanction Russia with desu. In theory uncle Donald could threaten to give insane amounts of support to Ukraine if Russia doesnt agree to Peace, but I dont think he wants to get more involved. So idk what exactly he can do if Russia just says no thx.",1
The main problem for Russia was NATO coming right up to their borderThis is nonsense. Ukraine was never going to get the unanimous vote required to join NATO.The coup of the  was the real trigger.Everything since then has been an overreaction on their part. Yanukovych was not so important that it warranted any of this.,1

This is wishful thinking. If US could end this war and pressure Russia to stop Baiden wouldve done so already. Trump is trying to play a bit more friendly with Putin to allow him to back off the mess while keeping his authority and allowing him to claim victory. But it all depends on the political winds in Russia if they continue blowing the same direction Russia will keep on feeding more meat to the front and Trump has even theoretically low chances of changing anything about this. Besides he seems a bit less capable then Biden. But looking from the grand scheme it has been huge win of US against Russia and there is little to no reason for US to change any direction.,1

"The king of Odessa! This is what ive said since 2022. Russia is god at two tings. Lying and propaganda. We should already have Nato troops pushing Russia out of Ukraine by now. Russias economy was as small as Spain Before the war now they have 21% inflation. That said we should just crush Russia, their economy is so small that it will not hurt the west and they will NEVER use Nukes! We did it in 1945, let us stop evil one more time!",1

"Russia goal number one is the liquidation of the Ukrainian Military, this is stated, number two is Denazification, Seethe and Cope.",1
"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south.",1

Can they impose more sanctions? Or are they out of things to sanction?",1
Trump litteraly just burried Project Russia and all /chug/ can do is COPE KEK,1

Russia wont be able to do shit to us for at least  years. After that a lot can happen. The bigger danger is Germany turning on us but they are ALSO disarmed rn so they wont do shit for a long time either.,1
"There are several other scenarios in which Putins stupid war in Ukraine could end: • Ukraine and the non-Ukrainian volunteers currently in Ukraine helping them kill Russian invaders with continued material assistance from NATO countries could exhaust the capacity of Putin to continue supporting his stupid war effort in Ukraine, and the Russian invaders could be pushed back out of all the Ukrainian territory they occupy. • Putin could be assassinated or die and his replacement could decide to stop fighting Putins stupid war. • The Russian military could decide it has had enough of Putins stupid war and they could overthrow Putin and his Kremlin cronies and then withdraw the remaining Russian military from Ukraine. • A country that borders on Ukraine, like Poland, that knows it could easily be Putins next target if Putin is allowed to conquor Ukraine, decides to use its military without invoking NATO assistance to help Ukraine push back the Russian invaders and their North Korean buddies. • Another country, like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, or even China, could take advantage of Russias current weakness and distraction with its war in Ukraine, to decided to take back some of their land that Russia currently occupies like the peninsula of Russia to the east of China, opening a second front for Russia, which causes Russia to divide its military, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied in Ukraine. • Trump decides that if he cant get Greenland hell take one or more of the islands above the arctic circle that Russia currently considers theirs. This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. • etc.",1
EU has no such ambition or policyWe had great relations with Russia until US glowniggers came along to fuck things up ( yours too btw),1
"I really hope the guess one is Russia not voluntarily but via the various finding mechanisms from sanctions, the oil deal and confiscated equipment.",1
Russia could have accomplished a lot more with their soviet stockpiles if they werent retarded,1
"no, Russia wont attack NATO, Russia is defensive.",1
"The Nuland call was the opposite, actually. The EU was the one taking the lead exerting pressure on Ukraine to dump Yanukovych and undercut Russia at the time.",1
The russian federation has nuclear weapons and this will never stop untill russia gives up nukes. Also Russia is too big. Russia is so big they will always have enough people to threaten Europe. So russia has to be broken up in many smaller states.,1
Can you imagine working at an oil refinery in Russia right now. Fuck that.,1
"Its not hope, its common sense and a modicum of knowledge about military history and capabilities. Russia is fighting a defensive war in Ukraine against mutt encroachment, and mutt encroachment and provocation of Russia is required to keep NPCs like you scared and docile for the mutt protection racketNafotrannies Id venture",1
"let Russia win?Russia hasnt won. They just havent lost. The entire point of this war was for Russia to annex all of Ukraine. They got a chunk of it through glowie ops but couldnt take the rest in an open war, despite the SMO which went from  days to  years of conflict. Freezing the conflict entirely puts both Zelensky and Putin in a bad position and allows for regime change. The key word from Hegseth is honesty as in honest elections. Freeze the conflict and allow the Republics and whats left of Ukraine vote for new leaders. The Republics and Ukraine have both been run like police states up until this point and in all likelihood, theyd both vote to be one nation again. Putin doesnt want that, as it would undo everything hes been trying to accomplish since , it would be the end of his legacy and hed probably be killed. Zelensky doesnt want elections because he knows hes going to lose as well and be prosecuted for all the corruption hes engaged in up until this point.Russia is on the ropesThis isnt a movie. People are getting slaughtered on both sides for little gain but have sunk so much into the conflict that neither can stop. Russia can keep limping along for at least another year or two. Ukraine, perhaps another year. The Ukrainian defense will eventually break and Russia will take it but, it will be so bloody and costly that Russia will have almost completely depleted its military assets to do so. And Putin will inherit an insurgency in whats left of Ukraine on top of that.There is no winning this conflict for either side. Even if Ukraine pushed back all Russian forces tomorrow, they dont have the resources to fix whats broken in their country and will need aid. Better to freeze the war, let the nations vote for non-retarded leaders, and come to some kind of stable terms that will actually hold.",1
I gotta be honest its pretty revealing jist how excited ziggers are over such a nothing comment. They know in their bones that russia cant win so anything that looks like a last minute win feels like a miracle,1
He cant end it without Russia giving him permission.,1
"I dont think theres any chance uncle Donald will hand you more territory than youve won on the battlefield.It sounds like he does just want a line freeze like Korea.So question is does Putin agree? Or does Russia just try to stall for time while pushing on? Maybe America gets tired and just says we tried, this isnt our war, were out, so no more US support to Ukraine, and Russia keeps fighting for all those  oblasts?",1

"if russia had not taken crimea and ukraine had invaded russia, we might have been on Russias side. .. likely we would not have intervened ar all. we hate it when peaceful countries get invaded. we do not like aggressors and we do not like bullies. Ukraine wanted to feel protected by nato a defense, not an offense pact, apparently that was a threat to russia. ukraine just wanted to choose their own path, something we tremendously respect, unlike russia. Also, unlike russians who change the history books to their liking, we do not forget about holodomor. yea, we wont forget about you fighting nazis  alongside the Ukrainian ssr, and the sacrifice russia made. But we also do not forget Molotov Ribbentrop.... russia was the nazi ally, do not fucking forgot that. russia was also the aggressor in the winter war with Finland. stalin and hitler were happy to carve up eastern europe between them. so yeah, we have many reasons NOT to trust the russians. russia was happy to be with hitler until the nazis decided to end the friendship. if that had not happened, you would still be friends with the nazis. from own experience i know how racist the moscow russians are. those that are in power for sure. again, reasona against liking the russians. theres your answer, go find yourself some proper history books. so yeah, fuck russia, fuck putin and have a nice day.",1
"After Russia finally looses Putins stupid war, it is going to take ALL the Billions of siezed Russian Assets and all the proceeds from all the sanctions against Russia for the next decade at least, to help rebuild those Ukrainian towns.

The corresponding amendments to the Criminal Code (CC) authored by United Russia members Irina Yarovaya and Vasily Piskarev were approved the day before by the government commission on legislative activity, Kommersant reports. We are talking about the proposed abolition of the so-called principle of prejudice, when criminal liability for an offense occurs only after an administrative penalty. According to the draft law, this will affect, in particular, punishment under Article . of the Criminal Code (calls for the introduction of sanctions against the Russian Federation). If the accused supported anti-Russian restrictions for selfish motives or for hire, he will immediately receive a fine of  million to  million rubles or go to prison for up to five years (currently, the punishment involves a fine of up to  thousand rubles and imprisonment for up to three years).",1
Because youre letting Russia get away with a blatant land grab. This behavior is unacceptable and should be harshly punished. We should be completely barring all trade with them and sinking their shipping.,1
And Ukraine has been independent for all of thirty years and spent twenty of those years demilitarizing their country.Thats not really an issue for Russia. The main problem for Russia was NATO coming right up to their border and installing a NATO leader by overthrowing the old democratically elected leader. The coup of the  was the real trigger.,1

"Though I disagree with nothing said in the article after living and working there for 10 years... the premise is not at all correct. Russia invaded Ukraine for the simple fact that they were always going to take back the strategically important Crimean Peninsula and their long held port city and naval base at Sevastopol after the Soviet Union broke up... and in doing so, had no real choice but to attempt to create a land bride to Crimea... and knowing that all the rare earth minerals and gas fields were in the Donbass... they want to snatch that on the way by. Those outside of Russia have no idea what a massive slap in the face to Russia and their perceived sense of might it was when Ukraine said oh, you want to enter the base.... sorry, I dont see your name on the list The article is correct about the collective delusions and insecurity and how Russians cope with their past, how they rationalize violence and they are absolutely apathetic and indifferent to human suffering. But the reasons for Russias are very much rooted in practical military considerations. The reasons the population goes along with it particularly those over 40 are very much those expressed in the article. When I was 26, I was a consultant for a Russian/American joint venture in Russia in the mid / late 90s and guys would constantly and randomly blurt out facts about attack helicopters and MIGs and shit about them being the best in the world while were talking about what to eat for lunch or something completely inane. They are MASSIVELY insecure as a nation. They were told they were the greatest and the best for almost 80 years. Moscow was called Stolitsa Mira - The Capital of the World. Soviets were told day and night that they were the envy of the world and that everyone wanted to be them. They were told they had the worlds best tech, the worlds greatest military and the worlds strongest economy, had next to zero crime and that everything western represented everything wrong in the world. Then, they woke up and found out it was all a lie. Their life was a lie. Their very purpose in life was a lie. They found out they were 5 decades behind the rest of the world, that no one envied them and even worse... no one even thought about them at all. Forgetting about 2 Chechen wars, attacking Georgia, taking part of Moldova and 2014 attack on Ukraine... The last 25 years for Russia has been nothing but endless saber rattling, threats and demanding, but never earning respect.",1
