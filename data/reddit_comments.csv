no-flair,"After Russia finally looses Putins stupid war, it is going to take ALL the Billions of siezed Russian Assets and all the proceeds from all the sanctions against Russia for the next decade at least, to help rebuild those Ukrainian towns. Putin has ensured that Russia will be hobbled with paying war reparations for decades."

no-flair,"Love to see it, hate the pollution obviously but if this continues every day it surely starts impacting Putins power as the impact on so many aspects of the war and daily life mount for the military and the general population. At this point I want to see peace talks to save Ukraine lives both military and innocents however these continued attacks could really start to have significant impact especially as it seems Russia can’t do anything to stop them."

no-flair,She is correct.
no-flair,"She is right. But if she really means it, she can’t let Ukraine stand alone to defend itself. Then Denmark has to send troops. Same as that filthy NK leadership did."

no-flair,"I know its not really verified numbers, but how can there be so many personell losses still? When will operation human shield end? Theres a big difference in the number of heavy vehicles being destroyed, so I guess theres less hardware for the russians.

no-flair,"Yes. Australian. Those orc scum murdered Australians. They didnt hand over the murderers. So I hate them with a passion for what they have done to AUSTRALIANS, and, also hate them just as much for what they have done in Ukraine, and every other place that evil orc scum goes. I dont care if there is a full-on world war against Russia. They are scum and all they do is crime. The species cant afford clowns like that anymore."

no-flair,"101% to the end. Nearly regardless of how things play out. Who are any of the rest of the World to gripe given all the ridiculous corruption in the USA, China and Russia - regardless of “side” one takes. Russia invaded the sovereign territory of their neighbor with false claims. Putin is a POS and the people of Ukraine do not deserve the evils inflicted upon them. Slava Ukraini und Heroyam Slava!"
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,"Yes, absolutely."
no-flair,Yeah for sure
no-flair,"yes, naturally."
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,"Absolutely! Im an American that lived in Kyiv for two years. Im a Russian-speaker and I know firsthand the people Putin is calling ethnic-Russians are definitely not Russians and for the most part have no desire to be so. The Russians themselves do not see them as Russians, but as a people to be conquered and ultimately replaced. The Ukrainians need our help now more than ever. If we could ramp up support for another year or so maybe longer and outpace Russias incredibly slow production rates, they could be in a very untenable position. Getting Americans to support this very simple, economically sound strategy seems to be quite the uphill battle though. In 1-2 years, for pennies on the dollar, we could completely eliminate a major geopolitical foe from any degree of relevance for a decade at the least and refocus on China and the Pacific. But it seems the Realists have convinced too many uninformed people that doing this is going to somehow strengthen China, who is betting on Russia and the very outcome that many MAGAts are calling for - a geographically split Ukraine with no security guarantees."

,"Absolutely. I haven’t changed my fb profile pic from the main headline of “Russia attacks Ukraine” since 2022. I feel is the absolute least I can to do remind myself and anyone else that interacts with me of what’s going on half way across the world. Everything I see here is very sobering. I made a post way back then attempt to acknowledge why I don’t go fight. For better or worse: - I don’t know the land climate, and barely know the culture - I don’t speak Russian, Ukrainian, or any Slavic language - I’m not a soldier Of any of the above were true, then I might have gone, but at the end of the day, it’s not. Sure, I could learn… but that would take time, and that’s not what they need right now… so I have to believe I’ll be of more use some other way: controlling what I can in my sphere of orbit and vocally supporting Ukraine whenever possible. Slava Ukraini."
no-flair,In spirit I guess. Don’t actually care enough to act on it.

,"Have any of the ones that got hit come back online and repaired? I know the Russians are terrible at being able to procure spare parts because of all the sanctions, but they’re savvy at coming up with half measures that work temporarily. I wouldn’t be surprised if they come up with some pretty risky solutions to these being knocked offline"

no-flair,"Okay, I totally believe this isnt r*zzian propaganda. Shit it aint even good."
,The desperation is palpable. Poor man. Fuck putin.
,Im in the camp that its fake. Operation security reasons. They dont take personal phones into combat zones for risk of discovery and exposing their position. It takes a simple ping from your phone to a cell tower for the enemy to pinpoint exactly where you are and quickly airmail a 155m shell right into your trench.
no-flair,Poor soul - imagine having all of your hopes and dreams of this war ending on Trumps whims.
no-flair,This is so embarrassing. The war could have ended about a year ago if the West had not consistently failed to provide the necessary amount of weapons at all times. It is a disgrace.
no-flair,"No hope now Trump and Musk want to make plans about your country with Putin, Good Luck ."
,True or not. Everyone just wants the war to end
no-flair,"If I was a Ukrainian soldier I too would be searching the exact same things. And I also would want to rip the heads off any occupier I come across in my country. You can want both peace and to kill or eject any Russian occupiers. A search like that, even if true, doesn’t mean the Ukrainians are ready to give up as the propaganda pic would want people to believe."
no-flair,Nice Russian propaganda youve got there....
no-flair,I agree that there’s no proof it’s actually Ukrainian. But all the signs are pointing to it being Ukrainian.
no-flair,Best case scenario is a negotiated peace. Ukraine will lose more land and life the longer it drags out
no-flair,dorofeeva plum made me lol Its a leak
,That’s not Google searches. Those are suggestions based off what is trending in that area.
no-flair,VERY sad... Its hard to grasp how horrific a warzone is... May he rest in peace...
no-flair,"What a joke of this comment section. Same people who claim this is just Russian propaganda are probably the same who eat up media from any “credited” news source. You guys do realize how easy it’s become to fake anything. Even videos with AI these days. If you actually assessed the Google searches, I don’t see any reason why this would serve the interests of Russians. Most people on both sides want to go home. And everything from the “dollar exchange rate,” text in native language, and the text in English to look at news published by international sources adds up. And shows a clear theme of longing for the war to end."

They can do a lot more damage on the way out, but I just do not see any way for them to stop the bleeding at this point. Its only a matter of time before the rest of their empire starts crumbling."

,Could we please have a source to the original video post without the commentary?
no-flair,Be great if they just keep hitting a new section every couple of days once they have repaired the one previous. I guess with such long lengths of over ground sections there will be nothing Russia can do to stop it. Well hey there’s some hopium.
no-flair,"I’ve seen a NK propaganda film. They are taught that they are the most advanced and nation in the world, their dear leader is the most respected leader in the world, and have beaten the US in 3 different wars. They believe this because they have no other sources of information but this. Caveat: it’s a 2015 film called The Propaganda Game if you’re interested."

no-flair,Absolute piece of garbage this man is. The only reason hes in charge is his great power manipulating older generation of Slovakians and no competent person in opposition. He was even shot one time in public from like 5 metres and I always wonder why the shooter was not aiming on his head.

no-flair,"According to X, this guy is a Putin sympathizer, the prime rib of Slovakia, and upset because Ukraine is banning the transit of russian natural gas."

,Wtf? More propaganda. How long do they intend to keep this up? As if there’s someone out there that hasn’t heard this shtick many times over…
,"According to the article I read on the subject, they didn’t even TRY to renegotiate the transit agreement. So Ukraine fulfilled the contract and then supply ended when it expired obviously.

,Doing what it was designed for. Shitting on Russian T-tanks and bmps
no-flair,"This clip is quite old. Its interesting to see that the Leopard basically only used HEAT and not APFSDS. The first shot is normal but why subsequent shots didnt use apfsds can only mean that they have an Ammo shortage. Its pretty impressiv that a single Leopard was able to take out a complete convoy. Sadly the Leopard was later imobilized by enemy artillery, though the crew likely survived."
no-flair,Boom-Boom.

,"Dont know about pancakes, but it did make a whole lot of new holes to... uh... Im not gonna finish that sentence..."
no-flair,There’s just some about German tanks having a boost against Russian tanks 🤷🏻‍♂️I know it’s a bad joke
no-flair,"If memory serves, part of what ended WWII for Germany Japan was their inability to get fuel to their planes/tanks/trucks/etc. At some point, if Ukraine can sustain this, Putins armies will lose mobility, armored support and air capabilities. There will be no Marshall Plan for Russia. Russia will look the same 100 years from now as the day this war ends."
no-flair,Good work.
,Marshmallow land…🖕🏿🇷🇺
,"During WW2, USA has delivered up to 15’000 planes to USSR within first years of the war after 1941. I’m not comparing the production and supply chain. Obviously they are extremely different and can’t be compared. But I’m just talking about dedication then and now"
no-flair,What bothers me about these numbers is within the 1st year of the War Russia had close to a million loses. How is it lower 3 years later?
no-flair,Im sure someone got a load of cash for agreeing to hand over all the materiel.
,"It was a completely different context, in a sense, given that timeframe, the events, the actors involved and the zeitgeist, it might also be seen as an act of courage, vision even and hope. The last one to blame for it is Ukraine, from my understanding."
no-flair,"Well, if you survive get making some more again. Dirty bombs shouldnt be an issue with Chernobyl right there."
no-flair,Ukraine can certainly make nukes in no time! Do it!
no-flair,"Thats the sad thing of all. With the fall of the USSR, Ukraine agreed and abided by the agreements made. And they kinda shot themselves in the foot. The russians cannot be trusted."
no-flair,What happened?
no-flair,"If Ukraine had nuclear weapons wed literally be engulfed in a third world war right now, or living out the aftermath of nuclear strikes."
,"I dont think people realise that this is Zelensky hinting at whats going to happen if the US ceases military aid. It would be absolutely insane for Ukraine not to have begun work on a basic nuclear device for its own defense at this point in time. Expect more nations to develop their own nuclear weapons within a few decades. If you cant beat them, get them."
,Hindsight is 20/20
no-flair,Pretty easy to MMQB that decision. Russia literally agreed to the Budapest Memo.
no-flair,"Its an ahistorical opinion, honestly. The main reason Ukraine gave up its nukes is that it couldnt afford to maintain them. The US pressured them on this because of fears that would rapidly lead to dispersal of the weapons to bad actors. Its also why the Russian efforts to safely dispose of so much of their arsenal were paid for by the US."
no-flair,All of that from some “ falling debris “?
no-flair,"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south."

As a kid, I had to wonder if a nuclear war would destroy kill us all before I even became an adult. Nuclear terrorism...literally. But by the grace of God, I have lived long enough to see it come back to them. As I watch the fire rage, I have warmth in my heart for those tough people of Ukraine who are standing up to the thugs."

no-flair,It is kind of sad to watch this from the europe- people were very supportive back then. three years later when ukrainians by not letting their country fall did huge service to all european countries and i mean huge and to some smaller eastern eu countries maybe with existential impact. Now many of these countries and its people are turning away from helping ukraine. its very sad.

no-flair,"I’ve been following and cheering for Team Ukraine for 3 years. Will it ever end? It’s been too long with too many missed opportunities from supporting nations. Time for them to get off the sidelines and bust open this war and push Russia back behind their borders. National leaders were present yesterday at the the 80th anniversary of the German atrocity at Auschwitz. Yet, again we are watching a monster kill innocents day after day, and month after month, and year after year. Action to confront the bully, head on, by all supporting nations at the same time with overwhelming force is what’s needed to strangle the snake."

,Tough stuff in Kursk. Hold on. Peace will come eventually.
,Unauthorized?!? By whom?!? Its Ukraine. The only country who can authorise peacekeepers is Ukraine. Ruzzia has no jurisdiction in Ukraine. Theyre absolutely out of their minds.
,"Well as they will be in Ukraine, Ukraine simply needs to authorise them. Problem solved."
no-flair,actually were all tickled to hear you say that
no-flair,"Makes totally sense...... Mother nature, where is a deadly stroke when we need one... Cmon!"
no-flair,Well if Russia fucked off there would be no need for them!
no-flair,North Koreans are unauthorized lol
no-flair,Fuck pederassia and fuck putler!
,Unauthorised? Why does Russia think its the authority on everything outside its immediate borders.
,Merely trying to dissuade their deployment
,Turn em all.
no-flair,"Pretty sure the Ukrainians are still going to lose. Like how much longer can they really hold out for? Didnt they mention something about being short on supplies and ammo a few months back? This war is still taking like an embarrassing amount of time and resouces for Russia, but if theres any country that knows what its like to slog through a war for years before success, itd be the Russians. Idk guys Im just not seeing a Ukrainian win out of this war, even if NATO does keep pumping them with ammo and supplies"
no-flair,Cope
no-flair,💪🇺🇦🔱🇺🇦💪🎯💥
,Would this be the first stance by Israel in the conflict?
no-flair,"Makes sense honestly, most groups like that have old Soviet and ruzzian arms because of how cheap they are and how easy they are to get."
no-flair,"Picture is a mortar, not kornet atm…"
,"Is that picture really of Kornet ATGMs? They look like mortars. Like where is the relatively large rocket motor that is needed for the kornets range? Also, Im not buying that this is more than a rumor yet."
,Recycling.
no-flair,Hell yeah
no-flair,I would be keen to hear this from a more reliable source than the Telegraph
no-flair,Did these run this by Trump so Putin first ?
no-flair,Russia is already cracking from existing sanctions. Their interest rates are over 20 percent and still mass inflation.
no-flair,I don’t like the guy. But if squishing Putin makes him look like the ultimate tough guy… he just might do it.
no-flair,"Seems like no one here actually read the text of the executive orders passed over the last week.  This alone will have economic impacts on Russia;  There are timelines for them all, and its all just getting started."
,"Only if he can personally benefit from it, in both money and leverage influence plus ability to blackmail."
,"It’s a nice thought, sure"
no-flair,Agent Orange is all talk and entertainment. His words dont mean much at all.
no-flair,"He just froze US aid to Ukraine, as an American I have to say its time for yall to wake up and understand that you can no longer count on us. Find other sources of aid, this man has already betrayed you."
no-flair,This is wishful thinking. If US could end this war and pressure Russia to stop Baiden wouldve done so already. Trump is trying to play a bit more friendly with Putin to allow him to back off the mess while keeping his authority and allowing him to claim victory. But it all depends on the political winds in Russia if they continue blowing the same direction Russia will keep on feeding more meat to the front and Trump has even theoretically low chances of changing anything about this. Besides he seems a bit less capable then Biden. But looking from the grand scheme it has been huge win of US against Russia and there is little to no reason for US to change any direction.
no-flair,"The crushing would come along with destroying our domestic oil and gas production industry so there would be some pain. If you want to end fracking and make coal jobs vanish, flood the world with cheap Saudi oil and make America a net importer again."
no-flair,"Do it, do it now! Make sure you read that as Schwarzenegger would have said it."
no-flair,Trump is just as crazy as Putin. He will do it!
no-flair,If Trump has the balls and not bullshiting as usual
no-flair,He wont though. Because he is a Putin asset
no-flair,But he won’t.
,Trump could easily do this to no cons for himself. His cult of personality wouldnt care and his political opponents hate Russia already
,Can. Wont.
,"Then so did Biden, and Biden tried to end the war, so, I dont see Trump succeeding without giving Putin what he wants."
,"Trump is Putin’s lap dog. He just cut all aid to Ukraine. If Trump REALLY wanted to end the war, he’d increase sanctions, increase aid to Ukraine and lead NATO in enforcing a no-fly zone over Eastern Ukraine."
no-flair,"Just words, bullshit trump talks then does nothing or gives out 10% of all he said."
no-flair,It’s bizarre because this is not what anyone thought he’d be doing and it’s almost exactly what Biden was doing. Now it’s good because it’s Trump?
no-flair,Yeah ? Go on then dickhead and see what happens..... And you voted for this twat apparently?
,"This has been a massively successful operation, I wonder how much economic damage has been done from refinery hits?"
no-flair,Burn Russia burn 🔥
no-flair,Is there a map anywhere with details on all the oil infrastructure hits?
no-flair,The best way for Germany to keep the ruZZian army at a safe distance is to provide the long range weapons that Ukraine needs.
no-flair,"If you are worried that the war in Ukraine will become your own, then stop half-assing the war."
,Just give it some time. No doubt Trump will come from a meeting with Putin with a document that represents peace in our time. Itll happen right before his European invasion.
,They are exactly halving the aid to Ukraine…?!
no-flair,"Which part is heart-stopping? Footage is great, but the title is click bait."
,Good footage but not heart-stopping.
,Gotta be a bot post because this shit aint heart stopping.
,Not sure why you felt the need to hype up a 5 second video of absolutely nothing happening.
no-flair,Watched the video. Heart stopped. Now Im dead. Posting this on Redeadit.
no-flair,"OP is 100% a bot lol, no way a person with functioning brain cells combined this video with that title."
no-flair,What’s with the CNN headline post title?
no-flair,Overstated
no-flair,Holy shit i just woke up
no-flair,"Not heart stopping for sure…..go bring the hate boys, let it rain."
no-flair,"If ruSSia is not defeated, broken, then it will simply pause, rebuild and go again. It MUST be utterly finished"
no-flair,"Merz must first return all his bribes and afd borrowed talking points. Dont believe or trust that guy, he is not interested in Ukraine, Germany or Europe."
no-flair,"Short on tanks again, but other vehicles getting battered. Good stuff."
no-flair,I doubt Putin or Kim care at all.
no-flair,No way. That would mean theyd be losing nearly as much as the Russians. I doubt this.
no-flair,"Is there is even 30,000 in Ukraine right now?"
no-flair,"I think the real news here is that the intelligence agencies of various states including South Korea believe fresh North Korean troops might arrive in Russia to assist in the Ukraine war within the next few months. North Korea has only sent 11,000 men or so, but that number could double soon."
no-flair,The battle is getting “unfair”! Well the world will have lesser 30k-40k people.
,They only send 10k according to South-Korean MOD???
,"Come on South Korea, fill in for the US"
no-flair,"Title is a mis-statement of the actual articles findings. ISW estimates Russian casualties are 30 to 45 thousand a month - among those losses is approx 4 thousand North Koreans of an estimated 11 to 12 thousand deployed. At the rate of current losses North Koreans casualties will be 100% by mid-April. Note: Casualties are killed, captured, and wounded - many of the wounded will be able to return to duty after a short period if they are even allowed to leave the front lines despite being wounded. So even if they reach 100% casualties there will still be North Koreans left on the front lines."
,"The troops they are sending seem to be their best and soon they’ll have depleted their special units to a point where. North Korea is vulnerable. I’d expect KJU to be reticent to send many more than about 20,000 in total."
no-flair,Man i think they are losing 450000 a day ... Vor maybe even 4500000 an hour i red somewhere
,Sure buddy
no-flair,So nice
,"I think now that Trump is in office , Ukraine should test the US by going after Russia’s power grid just as Russia does every night. Test them and poke the US to draw a new line in the sand. I hate Trump, But Biden was too critical on what Ukraine could hit"

no-flair,Low impact target.
no-flair,Glorious
no-flair,Could watch this all day. Great job.
no-flair,"Fuck, I’d just hand Ukraine all the money."
no-flair,"How is there still unused sanctions and assets? I remember in the first months of the war they were tracking down super yachts of Russian oligarchs, and seizing them around the world. Bank accounts were being drained as fast as they could be found."
,"Which will end to be the only action compatible to mr. I will end the war in 24 hours. Good enough, though. Depleting the enemy of their assets while speaking the only language they can understand is the right direction."
,He is all fuckin talk.

no-flair,I thought they all got captured. They had green tape on them and I remember seeing a video of a group of green taped soldiers being walked in a line hands behind their back with a Russian pointing an AK and a camera. But that was like a year ago. I hope these guys fair better. Like this war hasn’t been easy for anyone.
no-flair,"I thought, Trump would end it in 24 hours? !gif"
no-flair,"There are several other scenarios in which Putins stupid war in Ukraine could end: • Ukraine and the non-Ukrainian volunteers currently in Ukraine helping them kill Russian invaders with continued material assistance from NATO countries could exhaust the capacity of Putin to continue supporting his stupid war effort in Ukraine, and the Russian invaders could be pushed back out of all the Ukrainian territory they occupy. • Putin could be assassinated or die and his replacement could decide to stop fighting Putins stupid war. • The Russian military could decide it has had enough of Putins stupid war and they could overthrow Putin and his Kremlin cronies and then withdraw the remaining Russian military from Ukraine. • A country that borders on Ukraine, like Poland, that knows it could easily be Putins next target if Putin is allowed to conquor Ukraine, decides to use its military without invoking NATO assistance to help Ukraine push back the Russian invaders and their North Korean buddies. • Another country, like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, or even China, could take advantage of Russias current weakness and distraction with its war in Ukraine, to decided to take back some of their land that Russia currently occupies like the peninsula of Russia to the east of China, opening a second front for Russia, which causes Russia to divide its military, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied in Ukraine. • Trump decides that if he cant get Greenland hell take one or more of the islands above the arctic circle that Russia currently considers theirs. This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. • etc."
no-flair,I hope the Netherlands punishment for traitors remains the same as just after the War.
News Agency,"From The Telegraph: Bulgaria stands to receive about €500 million £415 million from its military support to Ukraine over the past three years. “By helping Ukraine, we are actually helping ourselves,” Atanas Zapryanov the defence minister, said. Sofia benefited from about €300 million in compensation from the United States and the European Commission for sending Soviet-era military hardware to Kyiv. It also received €174 million from Denmark  part of two contracts to support Ukraine’s military in its struggle against the Russian invasion Eastern European countries with arsenals of Soviet-era weapons became crucial in the West’s military support for Ukraine.

no-flair,Is there even anything left to sanction which hasnt already been? Any possible sanctions which are both enforceable and meaningful left?
no-flair,So do it!!!!!!!!
no-flair,We are going to have to sanction dual purpose donkey exports to Russia
no-flair,I dont think Putin has ever even been to Ukraine though.
no-flair,"He should face international court anyway, he more than earned his right to hang by the neck until dead."
no-flair,I didnt think anybody these days needed a further reminder that nobody gives a damn about international court. After the past week any statement with a threat of implementing international law sounds almost comical.
no-flair,This week Trump sanctioned the international Criminal Court for issuing an arrest warrant for war criminal against the Israeli prime minister.
no-flair,"He needs to face the court for his war crimes, regardless. Russia also needs to pay reparations. They need to feel the consequences for generations."
no-flair,"Come on Kim, a three day special military operation?"
no-flair,Well put. On a landmine.
no-flair,Just one? Rather surprised that they allowed any to stay.
no-flair,Nice one Bulgaria and Denmark👍👍
no-flair,"They just leaked Trumps plan to end the war, and he is really screwing Ukraine over. :"
no-flair,"Isnt it clear by now that Russia doesnt give a fuck what you do sanction wise! They literally have Gov interest rates higher than our credit cards! They dont pay their meatwaves, they just entice them with fake bonuses that never get cashed cause its a oneway ticket to Ukraine. Russians only understand violence. I mean they literally beat their wives LEGALLY. And rape each other in prison for fun. Youd have more of an effect by bombing all their vodka distilleries. Send Ukraine some nukes capable of hitting Moscow, and youve won. Once Putin knows Ukraine has nukes, hell pull out. If youre too pussy to send nukes, then atleast send missiles capable of hitting Moscow. Also start kidnapping all the Russian Oligarchs kids that are overseas in London, Paris, Zurich, Dubai etc... once you have their families, theyll do anything to get them back and that means a full withdrawal from Ukraine in exchange for their release. Im honestly surprised this hasnt happened already. These Russian Oligarch kids are fucking idiots hitting nightclubs all the time. A special ops Ukrainian unit could easily pick them up in those cities. Sure they have some armed Russian mafia bodyguards, wtf are they going to do against Ukrainian special ops. Theyll be dead before they even know what it em. GO AFTER THE OLIGARCHS KIDS. KIDNAP THEM FOR MASSIVE LEVERAGE."
no-flair,"This is an announcement about an announcement. If you can do anything, you shoulda done it already, Donald."
no-flair,Hahahahaha that aint shit Russia spent decades divesting from any country that would actually enforce these Just fucking arm ukraine like we so eagerly arm netanyu
no-flair,"3 out of 10? with painful being what, 1 or 10? Blog/Opinion Piece theres no such thing linked"

no-flair,Orange Donnie don wanna squeeze his hero boyfriend too much....
no-flair,Time to expand the list. If you are Russia you are on it until further notice.
no-flair,Was just a propaganda machine hidden under the cloak of helping the world!
no-flair,Musk has called USAID a vipers nest of radical-left marxists who hate America. Trump said last week it was being run by a bunch of radical lunatics.
no-flair,Musk is aligned with Putin
no-flair,Elon Trump = Putin
no-flair,"Trump hands Putler another symbolic gift. More to come, Im sure. What a complete, and utter disgrace of a president."

no-flair,He doesnt have a plan for anything.
no-flair,The orange idiot has no plan for tomorrow
no-flair,"Don’t depend on Trump for anything, he is just full of verbal bull*t as is Putin. The U.S. Republicans are lock-step with Trump’s authoritarian ways, none dare to challenge him, no guts, no glory. President Zelenskyy you are a decent, honorable man and this American continues to fully support you and the Ukrainian people. Good people all around this world want Russia out of all Ukraine’s land. Hopefully, in 2026 decent Americans will take back control of government, meanwhile we will resist and fight like hell. Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🌻"
no-flair,Trump is the Great Idiot Whisperer. Ukrainians know better. My country... not so much. :-
no-flair,Yes he does. Hes gong to stop all aid to Ukraine.
no-flair,No shit. I hope he doesn’t abandon Ukraine…
no-flair,Never did have.
no-flair,"Yeah, well, if it ends now we won’t get all those sweet, sweet rare earth minerals he’s apparently been lusting after."
no-flair,Trump had no plan all along. That’s because he only knows how to talk through his ass.
no-flair,Its the North Crimean Canal
no-flair,Crimea needs that canal for water. Because it has no water Russia must transport water to Crimea
no-flair,"Oh, the poor local population. Or not."

no-flair,War crimes are their specialty.
no-flair,The spam on that site is horrendous.
no-flair,The Dutch are the best. I bet they even throw in a wheel of cheese or two with the equipment as a present for the boys.
no-flair,"I thought the Dutch elected some pro Russia guy, how are they aiding Ukraine then?"
no-flair,The dutch government does not have a winner takes all system but a multi party system where each party gets seats in the parliament equal to the percentage of votes. This means almost always that compromises and working together with different political parties is needed. Its a system that helps a bit against polarization and ignoring minorities. Not saying its perfect though
no-flair,Not a time to push Putin paranoia. Trump is already doing it to the max. We do not want nuclear war in Ukraine It has never been closer. Putin has a bankrupt country a military that is questionable and failing support. Every Ukrainian drone burning Russian oil shows Putin has failed. This is dangerous. Ukraine has no choice but to push on the West needs to help but quietly.
no-flair,"Off course they do! They are decendants of Stalin’s regime, which unlike Hitler’s regime has gone unchecked for generations."
no-flair,Do we have an age breakdown of this 67%? I have a feeling or hoping its going to be comprised largely of a demographic with one foot in the grave; predominantly those who believed in the CCCP.
no-flair,"Most of them are completely manipulated into thinking that they’re supporting a good thing, that the war is actually defensive and that they fight for human rights. In the world around them it is us who is supporting the violence and destruction."
no-flair,Yep! Most Russians now want Ukraine completely obliterated. The sad part is that 70% of Ukrainians now want a peace deal!
no-flair,A Russian authority surveys the Russian population... Right? RIGHT?
no-flair,PUTIN CONTROLS WHAT THEY SEE AND KNOW. JUST LIKE TRUMP TRIES TO DO..
no-flair,Is the VTsIOM independent? I heard about a study by russian government where people did not answer by there own opinion... So Im not sure I can trust this. Does anyone knows?
no-flair,"Yea, well, I hope ukraine just aimlessly shoots rockets and missiles at russia like theyve done to them. Fuck em"
no-flair,They asked three people and rounded up.
no-flair,"The entire ruzzian population is complicit, periode. Fuck ruzzia and their miserable people"
no-flair,"I worry that support for this war is waning. Ive been with you guys since day one and I often find a few days have gone by before I check in and see whats going on. We need to keep this fresh, always."
no-flair,And yet 99% wont sign up to die for their dictator amazing how easy it is to say something and refuse to back it up isnt it?
no-flair,"They used to be higher, but they seem to be dying off after trying to head into Ukraine."
no-flair,"This is the power of jealousy. Its a disease that spreads from one sick person to the next. We dont have what Ukraine has, so it is ok to take it by force. Resentment is a strong emotional trait that closes out other emotions like empathy, kindness, or fairness and leads to hatred."
no-flair,That’s why the Russian Federation needs to be dismantled bit by bit until what’s left can’t inflict misery on the world ever again
no-flair,Then 67 percent need to be taught a lesson
no-flair,Fuck North Korea and Ruzzia.

no-flair,Well crap. Guess it’s inevitable that even they could get something right. Let’s hope they explode during launch more!
no-flair,They have been devastating. They are relying on Chinese technology.
no-flair,"Podcasts I’ve been listening to suggest some theories surrounding combat ineffectiveness: they didn’t have any armor of their own, and the language barrier made it hard for them to be folded into Russian ranks to make a larger army effective force. Of course this could be completely wrong, but it sounds plausible."
no-flair,Their discovery force discovered they are not ready for war. I saw they were bringing in heavy motors by train. I bet they will redeploy soon and try again.
no-flair,So its not an info European language group You sound so American. And they certainly deal with none Indo-European g languages in their eastern occupied regions.
no-flair,"They are being rotated out. Intel indicates that 20,000 more may soon be arriving!"
no-flair,A real war against NATO goes nuclear. Putins final card is a nuclear tactical weapon. Against Ukraine not an insurmountable problem . If it is against NATO its Armageddon. there is a dance here and Putins economy is. Destroyed. What does he have left?
no-flair,See the full interview at

no-flair,"Im afraid when the 2 egos collide, neither will concede ground. Both have their eye on the same minerals."
no-flair,I was at a presentation at UNC with the Polish ambassador two years ago .When he said not to underestimate how far a Russian could go on a bag of potatoes and a head of cabbage. At a private reception the next day I looked at him and said the handful of buckwheat has easier logistics to potatoes. I worry how far they can go on a handful of buckwheat. The best shot today for Ukraine is a military breakthrough. Im not sure it has to be large.
no-flair,"Why would he want peace talks when Russia is winning? Every day that goes by, Russia captures more territory!"
no-flair,"Best result for Ukraine is that Trumps ego gets bruised by Putin. Everyone but Trump expects Putin to intellectually run circles around Trump but big Don, unsurprisingly, is yet to see it."
no-flair,
no-flair,"Exactly, he doesnt want peace talk at all. He thinks he can still win, russia is all in."
no-flair,"Putin and his pal Trump are now working together on a peace deal, that will leave Ukraine holding the short end of the stick."
no-flair,"In the latest moves, the Moscow Region Arbitration Court froze the assets of billionaire Dmitry Kamenshchik, owner of Domodedovo, one of the country’s largest airports.

no-flair,soon to be transferred to those that are not critical of the regime....
no-flair,"I live in New Zealand and our food prices rose 14% in 2024. Granted, its mostly corporate greedy, but this isnt unique to Russia."
no-flair,Just more fake feel good news.
no-flair,"Clickbait headline. Many countries have sustained more than 10% inflation for decades. Its not nice to the citicens, but doesnt predict collapse in any way."
no-flair,"10% isnt that much though, we had that post-covid as well lol"
no-flair,Every 3 days it’s “on the brink” yet refuses to collapse. So we aren’t clearly there yet.
no-flair,"Thats not even the real problem. Russia has already passed the point of no return for population and workforce collapse. Before the war they may have been able to solve it, but now theyre fucked. Now its just a slow descent into shit."
no-flair,Ive been reading the same thing for 3 years. Collapse already!

no-flair,Good
no-flair,"I tend to believe it will happen. Most of what I’ve read is sometime in 2025. Stop paying the military and see what happens. The thing is though, putin, he can’t stop fighting because peace won’t be good for him. Russians are going to have to take him out if they hope to return to normal for decades. Conditions for this are ripening."
no-flair,"Funny how many do not seem to understand thet economic downbreak is a process where the tripping point can only be found retrospective. They either use this for propaganda for Putler all is good, we will win or to put blame on sanctions not to work. It clear for all incl Putler that Russin economy is at the brick to break. How long this can be drawn noone can say. Maybe one year, maybe one week, who knows. But all know it will break. And the later it comes the heavier will be the impact as more resources have been squandered or stolen by oligarches ... or by putler and his group. Edit, please remember, economy is not a one-trick-pony , so you have not to look only on Inflation but also on available workforce, delivery chains, raw materials, payments, preliminary products, non faked exchange rates, innovation climatics, ... and lots more"

no-flair,He said Russia.. would struggle to fight against thirty-three countries not three. Hes talking about NATO getting their fucking act together and making retreat an easy decision for the creepy little Russian dictator that loves playing with dolls so much.

no-flair,Absolutely. Its like Ursula said a couple of years ago - the Russians are running out of microchips stolen from Ukrainian dishwashers so pretty soon they will not be able to make any more missiles. The victory is close.

no-flair,"You are ridiculous, tankie. Stepan Bandera is a historical character, not a politician. His ideology is forbidden and strictly prosecuted in Ukraine, and it hasnt and never had any influence in independent Ukraine. Glorification of him is symbolical, not political - like Americans are glorifying George Washnigton as a war leader, but not as a slaver, while he actually was the one. Stepan Bandera was not a positive figure at all, but unfortunately he was the most known fighter for independent Ukraine, and tbis is why he is being recognised."
no-flair,Clearly Mr Bandera was not very good at being a Nazi as he died in a Nazi concentration camp. Unlike many other ex Nazis who went on to successful political careers after the war. Isnt that right Mr Waldheim?
no-flair,Ukrainians were facing extermination from the Russians when the Germans arrived during the war. The only logical thing to do was join the Germans. When the war ended ukranians fighting in allied armies That is British and US were forced back to Soviet occupied Ukraine. They faced a minimum of twenty years in a penal colony where five year sentence was considered a death sentence. at least 6000 American prisoners of war liberated by the Russians were marched into the Russian penal colonies and given twenty year sentences. Bandura had no choice but to fight.
no-flair,"if russia had not taken crimea and ukraine had invaded russia, we might have been on Russias side. .. likely we would not have intervened ar all. we hate it when peaceful countries get invaded. we do not like aggressors and we do not like bullies. Ukraine wanted to feel protected by nato a defense, not an offense pact, apparently that was a threat to russia. ukraine just wanted to choose their own path, something we tremendously respect, unlike russia. Also, unlike russians who change the history books to their liking, we do not forget about holodomor. yea, we wont forget about you fighting nazis  alongside the Ukrainian ssr, and the sacrifice russia made. But we also do not forget Molotov Ribbentrop.... russia was the nazi ally, do not fucking forgot that. russia was also the aggressor in the winter war with Finland. stalin and hitler were happy to carve up eastern europe between them. so yeah, we have many reasons NOT to trust the russians. russia was happy to be with hitler until the nazis decided to end the friendship. if that had not happened, you would still be friends with the nazis. from own experience i know how racist the moscow russians are. those that are in power for sure. again, reasona against liking the russians. theres your answer, go find yourself some proper history books. so yeah, fuck russia, fuck putin and have a nice day."
no-flair,"Lets talk about russians Nazi, the founder of the rusich group,  Alexey Milchakov: OP can ask information directly to his countryman, without disturbing wikipedia..."

no-flair,"When they attacked Ukrainian positions, the colonel said, Pyongyangs fighters sustained most of their casualties in the first few minutes of the assault. They repeatedly attack along the same routes where dozens of their troops have already been killed in action, Kindratenko said. Pyongyangs troops were very mobile, with some of the fighters shedding the protective gear Russia had provided, he said. In some instances, they operate without helmets or ballistic plates to increase speed during assaults on Ukrainian positions, Kindratenko said. Their confiscated backpacks held only scant food, a liter of water, and no cold-weather gear like gloves or thermal clothing. Most of the space in the Russian-issued backpacks is taken up by ammunition, the colonel said. North Korean troops have more than three times the number of magazines than the average Russian soldier carries, Kindratenko said, plus the supplies of grenades and landmines. Equipment recovered from the bodies of slain North Korean soldiers in Kursk indicate they are often better armed than Russian forces, the colonel added. The title seems a bit disingenuous. No helmets by choice =/= no helmets at all"
no-flair,No need for helmets ... They only protect your head.

Musk is acting with power like a monarch, overturning spending that was passed by Congress and signed off by former presidents for decades. This is the worst crisis in U.S. history."

no-flair,"We laugh at Russian drunkards, who sign up for a couple hundred dollars to die in a war that only benefits olligarchs. But higher class Russians arent dumb. They recruited Trump as an agent of influence 40 years ago, and have used him for the past near-decade to undermine all the efforts of generations of American public servants since WWII. If the face of America becomes this narcissistic bully Trump, every peace securing multilateral alliance is weakened or gone. Were back to the early 20th century again in terms of how nations respect another. It would be just disastrous for US foreign policy 40 years ago, but now that we know more about anthropogenic climate change and its effects that extend thousands of years into the future, its suicidal for human civilization. To put this in perspective, the election of Trump reduced global human carrying capacity by about 1% going forward, for the next 5-9 thousand years. Meaning every Trump voter in effect murdered a future human being."
no-flair,"This will end very bad. Allies? Yeah, Israel, but their European partners , like Denmark who had the most KIA per capita of all countries in Afghanistan, can’t rely on US. It would be more normal if US could say/ do something bad against Russia. But no, they are pals, same leadership. Many countries don’t feel secure to share intel with the new administration because Trumps pick Tulsi Gabbard, Kremls ”girl”.. I think this is going to have real bad consequences for all involved. And all shit about renaming places;George Washington Channel instead of English Channel? Bizarre. And Musk idiotic idea of change Mount Rushmore.. In what way? Add Trump.. I thinking of all parody Mad Magazine covers with Alfred E Neuman at Mt Rushmore, that would be more sane. Trump want to go to history as the president who expanded US landmass’s. He’s just thinking about his ego in every decision. And the grocery prices, have they gone down? It’s like a elefant in a porcelain shop..🇸🇪🇩🇰🇫🇮🇳🇴🇮🇸🇫🇴🇬🇱🇪🇺"

no-flair,"My vote for dumbest trade wars are as follows: Pastry War 1838-1839: This conflict began when a French pastry chef, Remontel, asked the Mexican government to pay damages after his shop was destroyed by a mob. When the Mexican government ignored his request, Remontel asked the French government for help. Ten years later, King Louis-Philippe of France demanded Mexico pay Remontel, including a 90% interest rate. When Mexico refused, France blockaded Mexico and occupied Veracruz. Kettle War 1784: This war started when the Holy Roman Emperor wanted ports in the southern Netherlands open to trade via the River Scheldt. Instead of negotiating, the emperor sent a flotilla of ships, including the flagship Le Louis. The Dutch responded with a single ship, the Dolfijn, which fired one shot at Le Louis, hitting a soup kettle. The flagship surrendered immediately, and the war ended. Jenkins Ear War 1739-1748: The war began after a British trader, Robert Jenkins, had his ear cut off by Spanish authorities in 1731. Eight years later, the British used this incident as an excuse to force Spain out of the Caribbean and South America. The war saw 25,000 dead or wounded and nearly 5,000 ships lost, but the conflict was overshadowed by the War of Austrian Succession. Dumb enough for you?"

Agree to all directions given by EU/NATO, failure to do so can be deemed criminal act of terrorism and all measures can be used by EU/NATO in response, no less than seizure of crew, vessel and all cargo, the full holding fee and criminal prosecutions as appropriate. 7. Moreover, any failure to comply with pilot directions and control measures can result in suspension of all movement of vessels to/from Russia via Baltic. All vessels in passage will be seized and held in EU port areas and special moorage charges will be applied to the holding fee as non returnable; and 8.

no-flair,"Alexandra Prokopenko Putin Is Not Yet Desperate: Economic Pain Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine in Foreign Affairs: If Western capitals cannot bank on the imminent collapse of the Russian economy, they must face the reality that Russia will pose an immense challenge for the next year or more. The United States and Europe will need to sustain Ukraine through this critical period, working together to bolster sanctions enforcement and finding ways to manage potential shifts in U.S. policy or fractures within the European Union. Eventually, the cumulative toll of Russia’s war economy will need to be paid. The West should be planning for that contingency now in order to capitalize on the opportunity when economic collapse becomes an urgent, unavoidable reality for Putin. But Ukraine’s backers should not expect that moment to arrive any time soon. Richard Connolly Russias Wartime Economy isnt as Weak as it Looks for RUSI: Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, \the Russian economic system\ is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives. For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised."

no-flair,Yes

,I support them definitely. Because of the innocence that live there.
no-flair,Yes I do! Just submitted my monthly $500 to Ukraine since few months started war. Always support Ukraine for their freedom!
no-flair,F*ck Putin
no-flair,I do. United24 every month
no-flair,"With every tax dollar Ive contributed since 1990. Growing up I was taught that Russia was the enemy, and all the money we spent on defense was spent to combat Russia. Now that that money is going toward its original intended use Im totally happy about that."
no-flair,"Yes. Australian. Those orc scum murdered Australians. They didnt hand over the murderers. So I hate them with a passion for what they have done to AUSTRALIANS, and, also hate them just as much for what they have done in Ukraine, and every other place that evil orc scum goes. I dont care if there is a full-on world war against Russia. They are scum and all they do is crime. The species cant afford clowns like that anymore."

no-flair,"101% to the end. Nearly regardless of how things play out. Who are any of the rest of the World to gripe given all the ridiculous corruption in the USA, China and Russia - regardless of “side” one takes. Russia invaded the sovereign territory of their neighbor with false claims. Putin is a POS and the people of Ukraine do not deserve the evils inflicted upon them. Slava Ukraini und Heroyam Slava!"
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,"Yes, absolutely."
no-flair,Yeah for sure
no-flair,"yes, naturally."
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,Yes
no-flair,"Absolutely! Im an American that lived in Kyiv for two years. Im a Russian-speaker and I know firsthand the people Putin is calling ethnic-Russians are definitely not Russians and for the most part have no desire to be so. The Russians themselves do not see them as Russians, but as a people to be conquered and ultimately replaced. The Ukrainians need our help now more than ever. If we could ramp up support for another year or so maybe longer and outpace Russias incredibly slow production rates, they could be in a very untenable position. Getting Americans to support this very simple, economically sound strategy seems to be quite the uphill battle though. In 1-2 years, for pennies on the dollar, we could completely eliminate a major geopolitical foe from any degree of relevance for a decade at the least and refocus on China and the Pacific. But it seems the Realists have convinced too many uninformed people that doing this is going to somehow strengthen China, who is betting on Russia and the very outcome that many MAGAts are calling for - a geographically split Ukraine with no security guarantees."
no-flair,Support what?
no-flair,Of course

,"Absolutely. I haven’t changed my fb profile pic from the main headline of “Russia attacks Ukraine” since 2022. I feel is the absolute least I can to do remind myself and anyone else that interacts with me of what’s going on half way across the world. Everything I see here is very sobering. I made a post way back then attempt to acknowledge why I don’t go fight. For better or worse: - I don’t know the land climate, and barely know the culture - I don’t speak Russian, Ukrainian, or any Slavic language - I’m not a soldier Of any of the above were true, then I might have gone, but at the end of the day, it’s not. Sure, I could learn… but that would take time, and that’s not what they need right now… so I have to believe I’ll be of more use some other way: controlling what I can in my sphere of orbit and vocally supporting Ukraine whenever possible. Slava Ukraini."
no-flair,In spirit I guess. Don’t actually care enough to act on it.
no-flair,My opinion on Ukraine has never swayed. We gave them their word when Ukraine gave up their nuclear arsenal. I dont understand why this is never mentioned in this media.

no-flair,100%

no-flair,"Absolutely. In fact, it concerns me a bit that people have forgotten about Ukraine because of the conflict in Gaza. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s important too, but at the same time we can’t forget about continuing to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia."
no-flair,What’s changed?
,Yes I wish I could do more. But I do what I can
no-flair,"Supporting Ukrainians is glory to humanity , dignity , freedom from domination. I wonder if we Canadians would support such assault against our country...poo-tin number2 is our neighborg , do our politicians realise the snake ramping under our borders ?"

,"They had people plant the explosives, so why not use a timer to detonate them? A drone seems more likely to fail."
no-flair,"I know its not really verified numbers, but how can there be so many personell losses still? When will operation human shield end? Theres a big difference in the number of heavy vehicles being destroyed, so I guess theres less hardware for the russians. This would be the time for the world to really step in and give the Ukraine army what they need and deserve."

no-flair,Wow. Just wow. No Ukrainians were lost doing this.

no-flair,"Wow, that’s speedy! Crippling their “money highway” and we will hear their cars coming to a HALT!"
no-flair,"Is this ALL of the major refineries in Russia, or did they just pick out a few of many that exist ? I love the idea that MOST of the refineries are down."
,"Have any of the ones that got hit come back online and repaired? I know the Russians are terrible at being able to procure spare parts because of all the sanctions, but they’re savvy at coming up with half measures that work temporarily. I wouldn’t be surprised if they come up with some pretty risky solutions to these being knocked offline"
no-flair,Blow them up
no-flair,According to the DOD report as today Russia’s oil refining capacity is reduced by 17%. Someone is full of shit and I’m pretty sure it not the DOD 😄

no-flair,What is the obvious effect when these are all out of commission? No more oil exports and war revenue other than taxes?
no-flair,Getting close to a bingo!
,It’s genocide. It was planned as genocide from the outset and continues to be genocide. I wish that states and UnSC would recognise this and thereby set the obligations to Prevent and Punish Russia and Putin - as required in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

no-flair,"Oh dear, everything appears to be running out for the Russians.. except for meat waves."
no-flair,Theres no evidence of this being the actual phone of an actual Ukrainian soldier that has been killed by russian forces and not just someone making a propaganda picture.
no-flair,"Okay, I totally believe this isnt r*zzian propaganda. Shit it aint even good."
,The desperation is palpable. Poor man. Fuck putin.
,Im in the camp that its fake. Operation security reasons. They dont take personal phones into combat zones for risk of discovery and exposing their position. It takes a simple ping from your phone to a cell tower for the enemy to pinpoint exactly where you are and quickly airmail a 155m shell right into your trench.
no-flair,Poor soul - imagine having all of your hopes and dreams of this war ending on Trumps whims.
no-flair,This is so embarrassing. The war could have ended about a year ago if the West had not consistently failed to provide the necessary amount of weapons at all times. It is a disgrace.
no-flair,"No hope now Trump and Musk want to make plans about your country with Putin, Good Luck ."
,True or not. Everyone just wants the war to end
no-flair,"If I was a Ukrainian soldier I too would be searching the exact same things. And I also would want to rip the heads off any occupier I come across in my country. You can want both peace and to kill or eject any Russian occupiers. A search like that, even if true, doesn’t mean the Ukrainians are ready to give up as the propaganda pic would want people to believe."
no-flair,Nice Russian propaganda youve got there....
no-flair,I agree that there’s no proof it’s actually Ukrainian. But all the signs are pointing to it being Ukrainian.
no-flair,Best case scenario is a negotiated peace. Ukraine will lose more land and life the longer it drags out
no-flair,dorofeeva plum made me lol Its a leak
,That’s not Google searches. Those are suggestions based off what is trending in that area.
no-flair,VERY sad... Its hard to grasp how horrific a warzone is... May he rest in peace...
no-flair,"What a joke of this comment section. Same people who claim this is just Russian propaganda are probably the same who eat up media from any “credited” news source. You guys do realize how easy it’s become to fake anything. Even videos with AI these days. If you actually assessed the Google searches, I don’t see any reason why this would serve the interests of Russians. Most people on both sides want to go home. And everything from the “dollar exchange rate,” text in native language, and the text in English to look at news published by international sources adds up. And shows a clear theme of longing for the war to end."
no-flair,Fucking good. Keep it up Ukraine. At this rate in 6 months time they will have hit everyone. 😀
no-flair,Burnnnnnn
no-flair,Was it this one?  I just like context. Interesting Russian media says due to falling drone debris lol. You mean bombs?

,Until the next batch..
,Maybe they ran out of NK fodder?
no-flair,"Weird. You mean after getting curbstomped to the point that small groups of North Koreans started going after Russians, the experiment has ended? Russia is done. They can do a lot more damage on the way out, but I just do not see any way for them to stop the bleeding at this point. Its only a matter of time before the rest of their empire starts crumbling."

no-flair,84 % sounds quite achievable
no-flair,Be great if they just keep hitting a new section every couple of days once they have repaired the one previous. I guess with such long lengths of over ground sections there will be nothing Russia can do to stop it. Well hey there’s some hopium.
no-flair,"I’ve seen a NK propaganda film. They are taught that they are the most advanced and nation in the world, their dear leader is the most respected leader in the world, and have beaten the US in 3 different wars.

no-flair,"This clip is quite old. Its interesting to see that the Leopard basically only used HEAT and not APFSDS. The first shot is normal but why subsequent shots didnt use apfsds can only mean that they have an Ammo shortage. Its pretty impressiv that a single Leopard was able to take out a complete convoy. Sadly the Leopard was later imobilized by enemy artillery, though the crew likely survived."

no-flair,"Sure, Selenski is the enemy, not your fascist buddy who started the war without provocation and forced his hand ... Absolute hypocrite."

,"According to the article I read on the subject, they didn’t even TRY to renegotiate the transit agreement. So Ukraine fulfilled the contract and then supply ended when it expired obviously.

no-flair,Ukraine can certainly make nukes in no time! Do it!
no-flair,"Thats the sad thing of all. With the fall of the USSR, Ukraine agreed and abided by the agreements made. And they kinda shot themselves in the foot. The russians cannot be trusted."
no-flair,What happened?
no-flair,"If Ukraine had nuclear weapons wed literally be engulfed in a third world war right now, or living out the aftermath of nuclear strikes."
,"I dont think people realise that this is Zelensky hinting at whats going to happen if the US ceases military aid. It would be absolutely insane for Ukraine not to have begun work on a basic nuclear device for its own defense at this point in time. Expect more nations to develop their own nuclear weapons within a few decades. If you cant beat them, get them."
,Hindsight is 20/20
no-flair,Pretty easy to MMQB that decision. Russia literally agreed to the Budapest Memo.
no-flair,"Its an ahistorical opinion, honestly. The main reason Ukraine gave up its nukes is that it couldnt afford to maintain them. The US pressured them on this because of fears that would rapidly lead to dispersal of the weapons to bad actors. Its also why the Russian efforts to safely dispose of so much of their arsenal were paid for by the US."
no-flair,All of that from some “ falling debris “?
no-flair,"I wonder why the increasing pace of Ukraines attacks in Russia have not made it to more mainstream outlets yet. I have sometimes seen it mentioned offhandedly, but barely anyone seems to wonder how long Russia is going to be able to keep cobbling together a working infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ukraines drone capabilities continues to increase. They may soon be at a point where hundreds of drones are flying into Russia every single day maybe its already at that point?. If they actually reach their production goals, that number might rise to thousands of drones flying into Russia every day. If Russia cannot stop them, at some point, Russia just shuts down. The military will as always be the last to feel it. However, the economy will get hit hard. They are already spending a fortune to keep the Ruble from imploding, inflation is already a problem, and they are already at insanely high interest rates which again, costs the economy money. If the supply of oil, natural gas, and gasoline is significantly affected, this will hurt Russia in every economic area: higher costs, less to export, internal supply shortages. And at some point, even the military will start feeling the shortages. Well, thats assuming they have any vehicles left anyway. But even managing the ones they do still have will become increasingly difficult. Deciding where the dwindling gas supplies should go will become another point that Ukraine can exploit militarily. They send it north? Attack south."

Idk guys Im just not seeing a Ukrainian win out of this war, even if NATO does keep pumping them with ammo and supplies"

no-flair,Hell yeah
no-flair,I would be keen to hear this from a more reliable source than the Telegraph
no-flair,Did these run this by Trump so Putin first ?
no-flair,💪🇺🇦🔱🇺🇦💪🎯💥
no-flair,Russia is already cracking from existing sanctions. Their interest rates are over 20 percent and still mass inflation.
no-flair,I don’t like the guy. But if squishing Putin makes him look like the ultimate tough guy… he just might do it.
no-flair,"Seems like no one here actually read the text of the executive orders passed over the last week.  This alone will have economic impacts on Russia;  There are timelines for them all, and its all just getting started."
,"Only if he can personally benefit from it, in both money and leverage influence plus ability to blackmail."
,"It’s a nice thought, sure"
no-flair,Agent Orange is all talk and entertainment. His words dont mean much at all.
no-flair,"He just froze US aid to Ukraine, as an American I have to say its time for yall to wake up and understand that you can no longer count on us. Find other sources of aid, this man has already betrayed you."
no-flair,This is wishful thinking. If US could end this war and pressure Russia to stop Baiden wouldve done so already. Trump is trying to play a bit more friendly with Putin to allow him to back off the mess while keeping his authority and allowing him to claim victory. But it all depends on the political winds in Russia if they continue blowing the same direction Russia will keep on feeding more meat to the front and Trump has even theoretically low chances of changing anything about this. Besides he seems a bit less capable then Biden. But looking from the grand scheme it has been huge win of US against Russia and there is little to no reason for US to change any direction.
no-flair,"The crushing would come along with destroying our domestic oil and gas production industry so there would be some pain. If you want to end fracking and make coal jobs vanish, flood the world with cheap Saudi oil and make America a net importer again."

no-flair,Trump is just as crazy as Putin. He will do it!
no-flair,If Trump has the balls and not bullshiting as usual
no-flair,He wont though. Because he is a Putin asset
no-flair,But he won’t.
,Trump could easily do this to no cons for himself. His cult of personality wouldnt care and his political opponents hate Russia already
,Can. Wont.
,"Then so did Biden, and Biden tried to end the war, so, I dont see Trump succeeding without giving Putin what he wants."
,"Trump is Putin’s lap dog. He just cut all aid to Ukraine. If Trump REALLY wanted to end the war, he’d increase sanctions, increase aid to Ukraine and lead NATO in enforcing a no-fly zone over Eastern Ukraine."
no-flair,"Just words, bullshit trump talks then does nothing or gives out 10% of all he said."
no-flair,It’s bizarre because this is not what anyone thought he’d be doing and it’s almost exactly what Biden was doing. Now it’s good because it’s Trump?
no-flair,Yeah ? Go on then dickhead and see what happens..... And you voted for this twat apparently?
,"This has been a massively successful operation, I wonder how much economic damage has been done from refinery hits?"
no-flair,Burn Russia burn 🔥
no-flair,Is there a map anywhere with details on all the oil infrastructure hits?

no-flair,"If you are worried that the war in Ukraine will become your own, then stop half-assing the war."
,Just give it some time. No doubt Trump will come from a meeting with Putin with a document that represents peace in our time. Itll happen right before his European invasion.

no-flair,"Which part is heart-stopping? Footage is great, but the title is click bait."

no-flair,"Fuck, I’d just hand Ukraine all the money."
no-flair,"How is there still unused sanctions and assets? I remember in the first months of the war they were tracking down super yachts of Russian oligarchs, and seizing them around the world. Bank accounts were being drained as fast as they could be found."
,"Which will end to be the only action compatible to mr. I will end the war in 24 hours. Good enough, though. Depleting the enemy of their assets while speaking the only language they can understand is the right direction."
,He is all fuckin talk.
no-flair,Donald trump also doesnt rule out pooping in his pants or walking in on underage girls changing
no-flair,I wouldnt trust anything Trump promises any farther than I could throw him
no-flair,Theyve been saying that for like 2 years now
no-flair,I doubt Putin or Kim care at all.
no-flair,No way. That would mean theyd be losing nearly as much as the Russians. I doubt this.
no-flair,"Is there is even 30,000 in Ukraine right now?"
no-flair,"I think the real news here is that the intelligence agencies of various states including South Korea believe fresh North Korean troops might arrive in Russia to assist in the Ukraine war within the next few months. North Korea has only sent 11,000 men or so, but that number could double soon."
no-flair,The battle is getting “unfair”! Well the world will have lesser 30k-40k people.
,They only send 10k according to South-Korean MOD???
,"Come on South Korea, fill in for the US"
no-flair,"Title is a mis-statement of the actual articles findings. ISW estimates Russian casualties are 30 to 45 thousand a month - among those losses is approx 4 thousand North Koreans of an estimated 11 to 12 thousand deployed. At the rate of current losses North Koreans casualties will be 100% by mid-April. Note: Casualties are killed, captured, and wounded - many of the wounded will be able to return to duty after a short period if they are even allowed to leave the front lines despite being wounded. So even if they reach 100% casualties there will still be North Koreans left on the front lines."
,"The troops they are sending seem to be their best and soon they’ll have depleted their special units to a point where. North Korea is vulnerable. I’d expect KJU to be reticent to send many more than about 20,000 in total."
no-flair,Man i think they are losing 450000 a day ... Vor maybe even 4500000 an hour i red somewhere
,Sure buddy

no-flair,he is fully on point
no-flair,"Putins ego is soo big that he will never do such a thing. He will never admit that hes being defeated either. Or that his country is losing hundreds of thousands of soliders over this war. Putin will only negotiate if the deal makes Russia come out on top. Even with trump being president now, hes not going to negotiate with trump unless Russia gets the upper hand out of the deal. He will take nothing less. Thats just how he is. I think its going to take Ukraine giving up a lot more terrority then it wants for this war to end. And Putin wont stop until he gets that. Ukraine just needs to take an L on this one and give up some territory to stop hundreds of thousands more people losing their lives over a war that is over land."

no-flair,"There are several other scenarios in which Putins stupid war in Ukraine could end: • Ukraine and the non-Ukrainian volunteers currently in Ukraine helping them kill Russian invaders with continued material assistance from NATO countries could exhaust the capacity of Putin to continue supporting his stupid war effort in Ukraine, and the Russian invaders could be pushed back out of all the Ukrainian territory they occupy. • Putin could be assassinated or die and his replacement could decide to stop fighting Putins stupid war. • The Russian military could decide it has had enough of Putins stupid war and they could overthrow Putin and his Kremlin cronies and then withdraw the remaining Russian military from Ukraine. • A country that borders on Ukraine, like Poland, that knows it could easily be Putins next target if Putin is allowed to conquor Ukraine, decides to use its military without invoking NATO assistance to help Ukraine push back the Russian invaders and their North Korean buddies. • Another country, like Kazakhstan, Mongolia, North Korea, or even China, could take advantage of Russias current weakness and distraction with its war in Ukraine, to decided to take back some of their land that Russia currently occupies like the peninsula of Russia to the east of China, opening a second front for Russia, which causes Russia to divide its military, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied in Ukraine. • Trump decides that if he cant get Greenland hell take one or more of the islands above the arctic circle that Russia currently considers theirs. This will cause Russia to move at least half its military to northern mainland Russia for defence, which causes Russia to not have enough military capability left in Ukraine to keep the territory it has occupied. • etc."

,"Then what the fk are us Europeans doing? It better be making a European alliance and sending in the troops. Russia cant use other countries military, its one thing getting weapons from them its another using a countries military, we need to start preparing and if putin keeps up this shit we end it. Iraq style, massive air attacks with multiple waves using all the different jets we have that are great at different missions. We take out comms, AA defence networks, airfields, command and control centres and main factories fora war effort. We rule the skies they either surrender or fire nukes. Either way fk putin we cant let that egotistical maniac have his way anymore. Also if the US doesnt want too, tough luck its us in Europe that should be more worried. Ukraine has done an absolutely amazing job, but theyve had to fight a military thats classed as one of the best and even so they have numbers, we need to help Ukraine proper. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤝🇺🇦"

,"Legitimate question: why are Russian troops burning NKoreans faces to hide theyre NKorean when the whole world knows they are? Is Russian command telling their soldiers to do so, giving them the impression its mandatory to keep the secret?"
,"And NK will keep sending them until Ukraine smartens up and runs a leaflet campaign offering NK soldiers food, and freedom. As soon as they start taking up the offer, NK will stop sending them. Its litterally a worst case scenario for Kim."

no-flair,"I thought the Dutch elected some pro Russia guy, how are they aiding Ukraine then?"
no-flair,The dutch government does not have a winner takes all system but a multi party system where each party gets seats in the parliament equal to the percentage of votes. This means almost always that compromises and working together with different political parties is needed. Its a system that helps a bit against polarization and ignoring minorities. Not saying its perfect though
no-flair,Not a time to push Putin paranoia. Trump is already doing it to the max. We do not want nuclear war in Ukraine It has never been closer. Putin has a bankrupt country a military that is questionable and failing support. Every Ukrainian drone burning Russian oil shows Putin has failed. This is dangerous. Ukraine has no choice but to push on the West needs to help but quietly.

Of course this could be completely wrong, but it sounds plausible."
no-flair,Their discovery force discovered they are not ready for war. I saw they were bringing in heavy motors by train. I bet they will redeploy soon and try again.

no-flair,"When they attacked Ukrainian positions, the colonel said, Pyongyangs fighters sustained most of their casualties in the first few minutes of the assault. They repeatedly attack along the same routes where dozens of their troops have already been killed in action, Kindratenko said. Pyongyangs troops were very mobile, with some of the fighters shedding the protective gear Russia had provided, he said. In some instances, they operate without helmets or ballistic plates to increase speed during assaults on Ukrainian positions, Kindratenko said. Their confiscated backpacks held only scant food, a liter of water, and no cold-weather gear like gloves or thermal clothing. Most of the space in the Russian-issued backpacks is taken up by ammunition, the colonel said. North Korean troops have more than three times the number of magazines than the average Russian soldier carries, Kindratenko said, plus the supplies of grenades and landmines. Equipment recovered from the bodies of slain North Korean soldiers in Kursk indicate they are often better armed than Russian forces, the colonel added. The title seems a bit disingenuous. No helmets by choice =/= no helmets at all"

Musk is acting with power like a monarch, overturning spending that was passed by Congress and signed off by former presidents for decades. This is the worst crisis in U.S. history."

no-flair,There are no tariffs other than China. Canada just agreed to border enforcement
no-flair,"I hate to nitpick, but tariffs on North Korea would be physically impossible."
no-flair,"We laugh at Russian drunkards, who sign up for a couple hundred dollars to die in a war that only benefits olligarchs. But higher class Russians arent dumb. They recruited Trump as an agent of influence 40 years ago, and have used him for the past near-decade to undermine all the efforts of generations of American public servants since WWII. If the face of America becomes this narcissistic bully Trump, every peace securing multilateral alliance is weakened or gone. Were back to the early 20th century again in terms of how nations respect another. It would be just disastrous for US foreign policy 40 years ago, but now that we know more about anthropogenic climate change and its effects that extend thousands of years into the future, its suicidal for human civilization. To put this in perspective, the election of Trump reduced global human carrying capacity by about 1% going forward, for the next 5-9 thousand years. Meaning every Trump voter in effect murdered a future human being."
no-flair,"This will end very bad. Allies? Yeah, Israel, but their European partners , like Denmark who had the most KIA per capita of all countries in Afghanistan, can’t rely on US. It would be more normal if US could say/ do something bad against Russia. But no, they are pals, same leadership. Many countries don’t feel secure to share intel with the new administration because Trumps pick Tulsi Gabbard, Kremls ”girl”.. I think this is going to have real bad consequences for all involved. And all shit about renaming places;George Washington Channel instead of English Channel? Bizarre. And Musk idiotic idea of change Mount Rushmore.. In what way? Add Trump.. I thinking of all parody Mad Magazine covers with Alfred E Neuman at Mt Rushmore, that would be more sane. Trump want to go to history as the president who expanded US landmass’s. He’s just thinking about his ego in every decision. And the grocery prices, have they gone down? It’s like a elefant in a porcelain shop..🇸🇪🇩🇰🇫🇮🇳🇴🇮🇸🇫🇴🇬🇱🇪🇺"

no-flair,"My vote for dumbest trade wars are as follows: Pastry War 1838-1839: This conflict began when a French pastry chef, Remontel, asked the Mexican government to pay damages after his shop was destroyed by a mob. When the Mexican government ignored his request, Remontel asked the French government for help. Ten years later, King Louis-Philippe of France demanded Mexico pay Remontel, including a 90% interest rate. When Mexico refused, France blockaded Mexico and occupied Veracruz. Kettle War 1784: This war started when the Holy Roman Emperor wanted ports in the southern Netherlands open to trade via the River Scheldt. Instead of negotiating, the emperor sent a flotilla of ships, including the flagship Le Louis. The Dutch responded with a single ship, the Dolfijn, which fired one shot at Le Louis, hitting a soup kettle. The flagship surrendered immediately, and the war ended. Jenkins Ear War 1739-1748: The war began after a British trader, Robert Jenkins, had his ear cut off by Spanish authorities in 1731. Eight years later, the British used this incident as an excuse to force Spain out of the Caribbean and South America. The war saw 25,000 dead or wounded and nearly 5,000 ships lost, but the conflict was overshadowed by the War of Austrian Succession. Dumb enough for you?"

no-flair,"What exactly do these figures refer to? To pure military deliveries? It looks like a naive calculation. If you think and calculate a little further, other countries look good, too. For example, almost 1.3 million Ukrainians live in Germany and have access to the entire social system. Including housing, medical care, etc. There are also indirect costs that are difficult to calculate. For example, massive trade losses due to the boycott of Russian products and sanctions on Russia."
no-flair,The title is misleading. The video is about countries which support Ukraine the most looking at % of their GDP. Not the most the most aka in absolute numbers.
no-flair,Gotta be Canada. 3rd largest Ukrainian population in the world outside of Ukraine and Russia.

Pay an escort fee to cover all extra costs of monitoring and escort throughout passage and any moorage that is non refundable, payment no less than one month prior to proposed passage; 5.

no-flair,Thats an increase of from $3 per 500 ml to $3.50 for 500 ml. I drank more than that a day at 35 y/o. Thats $24.50 a week drinking a half liter a day. An average 35y/o makes $165 a week on Russia. 1/6 of a weeks wages would go to vodka if they drank a half liter of vodka a day.

no-flair,"You are ridiculous, tankie. Stepan Bandera is a historical character, not a politician. His ideology is forbidden and strictly prosecuted in Ukraine, and it hasnt and never had any influence in independent Ukraine. Glorification of him is symbolical, not political - like Americans are glorifying George Washnigton as a war leader, but not as a slaver, while he actually was the one. Stepan Bandera was not a positive figure at all, but unfortunately he was the most known fighter for independent Ukraine, and tbis is why he is being recognised."
no-flair,Clearly Mr Bandera was not very good at being a Nazi as he died in a Nazi concentration camp. Unlike many other ex Nazis who went on to successful political careers after the war. Isnt that right Mr Waldheim?
no-flair,Ukrainians were facing extermination from the Russians when the Germans arrived during the war. The only logical thing to do was join the Germans. When the war ended ukranians fighting in allied armies That is British and US were forced back to Soviet occupied Ukraine. They faced a minimum of twenty years in a penal colony where five year sentence was considered a death sentence. at least 6000 American prisoners of war liberated by the Russians were marched into the Russian penal colonies and given twenty year sentences. Bandura had no choice but to fight.
no-flair,"if russia had not taken crimea and ukraine had invaded russia, we might have been on Russias side. .. likely we would not have intervened ar all. we hate it when peaceful countries get invaded. we do not like aggressors and we do not like bullies. Ukraine wanted to feel protected by nato a defense, not an offense pact, apparently that was a threat to russia. ukraine just wanted to choose their own path, something we tremendously respect, unlike russia. Also, unlike russians who change the history books to their liking, we do not forget about holodomor. yea, we wont forget about you fighting nazis  alongside the Ukrainian ssr, and the sacrifice russia made. But we also do not forget Molotov Ribbentrop.... russia was the nazi ally, do not fucking forgot that. russia was also the aggressor in the winter war with Finland. stalin and hitler were happy to carve up eastern europe between them. so yeah, we have many reasons NOT to trust the russians. russia was happy to be with hitler until the nazis decided to end the friendship. if that had not happened, you would still be friends with the nazis. from own experience i know how racist the moscow russians are. those that are in power for sure. again, reasona against liking the russians. theres your answer, go find yourself some proper history books. so yeah, fuck russia, fuck putin and have a nice day."

no-flair,"Alexandra Prokopenko Putin Is Not Yet Desperate: Economic Pain Wont Turn the Tide in Ukraine in Foreign Affairs: If Western capitals cannot bank on the imminent collapse of the Russian economy, they must face the reality that Russia will pose an immense challenge for the next year or more. The United States and Europe will need to sustain Ukraine through this critical period, working together to bolster sanctions enforcement and finding ways to manage potential shifts in U.S. policy or fractures within the European Union. Eventually, the cumulative toll of Russia’s war economy will need to be paid. The West should be planning for that contingency now in order to capitalize on the opportunity when economic collapse becomes an urgent, unavoidable reality for Putin. But Ukraine’s backers should not expect that moment to arrive any time soon. Richard Connolly Russias Wartime Economy isnt as Weak as it Looks for RUSI: Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, \the Russian economic system\ is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives. For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised."

If Russia manages to crush the rule based world order they so despise, we will see individual states go back to schemes such as this in order to profit from their respective geopolitical advantages."

Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t the discussion of the launchers happen 5-6 months ago when Israel announced they will be replacing them with their own David Sling systems? Yeah ok that’s what I thought. This conversation and work began last summer… the DoD and Israel are just finishing what was started nearly 9 months ago, so NOT Trump.

no-flair,Who is gonna enforce it? What about Gaza??
no-flair,"Like you Im heartbroken that the world isnt doing enough for Ukraine even when Russia are committing atrocities on a near daily basis. However I think youre a little misguided if you think there really consequences for those in the US and UK? OK, there are instances of outrage from time to time, and in some specific cases - usually where orders were being ignored - individuals are prosecuted but war crimes committed through the chain of command? Rarely if ever prosecuted in US/UK, although UK does from time to time prosecute decades after the event as attitudes have changed. This seems to be especially true in US where they have refused to sign up to many of the conventions related to banned weapons in the first place, they dont recognise the ICC and they are not even full signatories of the Geneva convention they exclude Protocols I, II. All things they have in common with Russia. The US doesnt even consider many things as war crimes if they are perpetrated by their own armed forces yet they go after others for the same actions. How many members of the US military were held accountable for the slaughter of civilians in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflicts? They have even abused concepts such as illegal combatants to get around laws regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. In truth, I think this is the primary reason that many, the US especially doesnt challenge Russia on their war crimes because they are worried about the fingers that would be pointed back at them."
no-flair,The US is not the example you want to pick for a country that prosecutes its own war criminals..
no-flair,Outside of the whole USSR thing are they that particularly worse than others?
no-flair,"Hmm as if the world itself didnt commit all kinds of warcrimes itself, to be fair did you think the world in the past was all sunshines and rainbows? The british caused the bengali famines just so they could sabotage the japanese which caused millions in india to die and later manipulated pakistan and india to fight eachother. Or the french and what they did in south east asia? Should we talk about germans even? America with its natives or banana republics. Hey nato is full of assholes too by your point."
no-flair,"Yep. In Russia war crimes are driven policy from the top, and Genocide is what Putin planned and delivered- yet how few states have recognised this?"
no-flair,"We dont. They just dont play any role in my everyday life. But in my company we just ignore any quotations from Russia, way before 2014. Even if they are way cheaper than competitors."
no-flair,"prosecutions normally come after the war is over theres time yet... and modern technology really speeds up identification of the perpetrators - that guy who shot six Ukrainian soldiers in the back lately was doxxed only a few days after the incident, they had full name, D.O.B, passport number and photos of him"

Thats not bad of a prediction from a decade ago"

no-flair,"Real reason is to steal the natural resources, including the grain. And because they are hellbent."
no-flair,"A rather dull peace of propaganda designed for uneducated simpletons here in the West. The tale of a crudifued boy. Smh... If you want to get a much better idea on reasons - check Mearsheimer, Jeffrey Sachs and others on this matter."
no-flair,"Though I disagree with nothing said in the article after living and working there for 10 years... the premise is not at all correct. Russia invaded Ukraine for the simple fact that they were always going to take back the strategically important Crimean Peninsula and their long held port city and naval base at Sevastopol after the Soviet Union broke up... and in doing so, had no real choice but to attempt to create a land bride to Crimea... and knowing that all the rare earth minerals and gas fields were in the Donbass... they want to snatch that on the way by. Those outside of Russia have no idea what a massive slap in the face to Russia and their perceived sense of might it was when Ukraine said oh, you want to enter the base.... sorry, I dont see your name on the list The article is correct about the collective delusions and insecurity and how Russians cope with their past, how they rationalize violence and they are absolutely apathetic and indifferent to human suffering. But the reasons for Russias are very much rooted in practical military considerations. The reasons the population goes along with it particularly those over 40 are very much those expressed in the article. When I was 26, I was a consultant for a Russian/American joint venture in Russia in the mid / late 90s and guys would constantly and randomly blurt out facts about attack helicopters and MIGs and shit about them being the best in the world while were talking about what to eat for lunch or something completely inane. They are MASSIVELY insecure as a nation. They were told they were the greatest and the best for almost 80 years. Moscow was called Stolitsa Mira - The Capital of the World. Soviets were told day and night that they were the envy of the world and that everyone wanted to be them. They were told they had the worlds best tech, the worlds greatest military and the worlds strongest economy, had next to zero crime and that everything western represented everything wrong in the world. Then, they woke up and found out it was all a lie. Their life was a lie. Their very purpose in life was a lie. They found out they were 5 decades behind the rest of the world, that no one envied them and even worse... no one even thought about them at all. Forgetting about 2 Chechen wars, attacking Georgia, taking part of Moldova and 2014 attack on Ukraine... The last 25 years for Russia has been nothing but endless saber rattling, threats and demanding, but never earning respect."
no-flair,I remember early in the war the trolls were trying to say Ukraine killed many russians out of Reprisals. They could only name one victim and his murderer had a trial and went to jail. They never can definitively give an identity of someone who was murdered in such a way... Meanwhile Ukraine has a long list of victims with corpses and identities. Russia sucks... fuck Russia
